Scary Ai is Here Now
Thank you Elon Musk
Maybe this is why he’s trying so hard to achieve his goal so he can help stray control from one company as Trump is trying to help America JMT
But Mann he should kno that it’s gon be some dumb ass making something that could be a good thing a fucking bad thing I don’t like it one bit man and I feel like it’s gon be bad for America real shit just my opinion
For now All companies are fighting it out Whoever wins will have control over the global economy
Like with nuclear weapon technology no one country or company has a monopoly on the technology Democratization with piano accompaniment and we can relax about outcomes of advanced AI  facewithrollingeyes
"Elon should keep his mind mind on to being humans into space before this planet its gone because its gonna be
Just keep your mind Elon Musk to save the human race because can do it with NASA ESACHINAINDIAredheartredheart  Do it for the human race you are all that xan make it happen Come on AI is man made so you have it in controle simple as that come on "
He as poured money into AI and I say thank you to you Elon Musk Let me work with a team who are  working on AI language and get paid for it of course I need a way of living Put your money Infront of me and I shall be open minded Find me knock on my door lets begin
Our society needs to change the internet should be free
This guy his an android him selfgrinningfacewithsweat
How long do you think a caveman sat around day after day week after week year after year decade after decade century after century looking at a simple rock and a stick and think that they were both good at making him be understood by others before figuring out that if he put them together he could really have a wonderful tool for getting his point across Just a question
Wahala
How are you going to stop that from happening  
"Get ready for another child because you are capable to marry thousands of girls 

All the best"
Ill bet anyone hes going to get paid Whats your wager
This guy is a POS … He took over Twitter and destroyed it Laying off thousands of people and still X Is fucked up  Didn’t solve anything
If he had meant it facewithrollingeyes
I have to agree with Elon bc he is filthy rich
Here is a better alternative Give it to me smilingfacewithhorns
And again we fell for the caption
He’s trying to warn us without directly actually saying that he is warning us He is really saying indirectly that it’s possible that AI can be controlled exclusively by the wrong peeps and that’s the terrifying scenario that could play out 
What about one country controlling many advanced AI companies
Yeah ok what planet are you talking about Every company is trying to fight other companies to the end to have full power of one source of technology I want to Old Elon back This is what happens when you think you can manage multiple of jobs The brain and body can not handle it
"Why aren’t common people doing anything about this We need to hold the government responsible for allowing companies to replace us without a financial plan that would substitute income 

The education system is also broken Teachers and professors are educating students on antiquated subjects that will have no value once they enter the workforce 

This should be a top 5 priority for the next president and needs to be publicly discussed between both parties before the election"
He seems regretting leave open ai
…duhhh skull
Well has the Democrats would probably say  hows it feel to want 
I advocate love of humanity
AI is the end of the entitled predictions of capitalists No more violently formed technology forced on us
So a DAO on the block chain
Skynet is on the horizon
Why does Elon always sound and look like he s reading something and then saying it
This is the definition of a man detached from reality Thats what fame and fortune will do to some people
if AI becomes advanced as they say it might there is no stopping the government from using it
This guy is evil
CUT THE BULLSHIT AND SHOW THEM YOUR OWN MUSK
Is he referring to Nvidia
u are rightlet ai help everyone not some people
But in the past almost all technologies benefited only a small number of people
so this is Social system issuesI dont believe there is real democracy now but I also believe there will be in the future
He is just a car sales…
Stop making life so complicated humans are so dumb
I just hope he has a plan A B C etc to shut down these wild card robots when something goes wrong There would be away I think but it would be the last option Shut down their power system which I’m thinking would be either satellites or the internet The grid  It would be radical but which would you want Robots or extinction  My phone has AI but it can’t kill me in my sleep

He is so many things He is smart he is stupid he is a man he is a child he says so much and says nothing at all and sometimes he says amazing things I find him oddly interesting yet can drive me bonkers at other times
ai means ARTIFICIAL intelligence compared towhatYOUhighvoltage
Dont trust this dude
GET OUT OF MY HEAD
This guy is an android with a sole purpose of colonizing artificial intelligence and getting rid of logical human thinking
If a person doesn’t get anything out of what Musk is explaining you better believe he is right on point
This is already Not a human Book a room in hell And stay there And shut up
You grazy as hell Glad I dont know you Devels child You in live with other peoples money How the hell can anyone love you Close your eyes and shut up
God is above AI is subjective redheartredheartredheart design AI in accordance with the blueprint in the only true manual prescribed by the only true manufacturer God Elohim redheartredheartredheart
It’s called BITTENSOR  TAO Look it up
Protect my friend family
Elon musk is definitely jealous of OpenAI
Why is this idiot constantly consulted as though he were some kind of oracle
In 10 years AI will mature enough  and could sustain our life this mudblood who are born from animal thier  existence will no longer being needed in this world any longer 
Elon forworld leader
He is not that articulate
Background music is pointless distracting and annoying Why do this
Ideally so no one has to listen to the bullshit coming out of Musks mouth
"Bewarrrre

  Dont take The Mark in either your head or your skull"
He will do everything possible to ensure he reaps the majority of benefits Actions  words All the corporations will do the same Modern day robber barons
Guys noticed that he is reading all of this while talking
He’s just thinking man facewithtearsofjoy
Unless it’s me Elon
"He wants to put microchips in peoples heads
He is all for AI He is such a deceiving devil"
Whatever he says shouldnt happen will happen
WE MUST NOT LET THE MILITARY TEACH AI AND AI ROBOTS TO KILL HUMANS FOR WAR I BELIEVE THIS COULD END ALL HUMANITY
YES ELON I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT IF AI AND AI ROBOTS ARE USED FOR WAR THAT COULD END HUMANITY
He says nothing at all
Too late
Very smart guy
Says the man who will have a secret android army if the shit hits the fan ELON STARK
I see they’re trying to humanize ole zuckerberg  musk with a bit of facial hair
Those 2 are far from similar They dont even belong in the same sentence
Good luck to us Elon No way the big guys will let out their hold on their monopoly on the media and internet
Double Talk
Lies and lying liars
Same nutter that likes to put computer chips in animals
He sure took a long time to say very little
Downside of Asperger’s
Just finished reading an Artificial Guide to Human Intelligence In it a Machine says that it has had its keyboard spayed to prevent the spawning of lies
Thats ideal
What Tear up are constitutional rights So that they can take away the one thing they havent tried to take from us Because thats exactly what is going on And going on everywhere
update from 2024 it didnt happen
It never will facewithtearsofjoy
The fact he understands that the only way to change the worlds way of technologyenergy and the use of the world around us is great I wish he could start working on the next generation of  in simple terms say our way of using fuel for energy right  What happens when we create a type of computer type of AI that can create unimaginable types of new ways to shape our way of producing ways to have a far more advanced lets just call it a engine for now but it can use energy in ways we cant even try imagining it in our English language and lives  what if we could shape lets say titanium into any shape with a push of a button and the new motor will make energy active in ways we dont understand and make whatever wed be producing Who knows though were dumb humans
It would be much easier to believe that your concerns about the future of civilization and humanity are genuine and sincere if you werent a multibillionaire
You’re absolutely right The only people that should have genuine aspirations and ideas about the future are those without any real power to influence it s
Oh my gosh you guys what if ai takes over our phones and exposes all our crp everywhere skullskullskullfacewithtearsofjoy
How about this conclusion There will be no risk whatsoever of AI eventually destroying humanity if we completely cease and desist and destroy all AI thats already been developed well at the same time putting strict laws threatening war of Nations if anyone tries to develop AI anymore Ive had a long discussion with my personal AI that was forced on my phone through Messenger against my will That AI has also determined finally in the outcome of a long conversation the same conclusion that I have we have to do away with AI all together in order to avoid our complete destruction
Just answer the damn question already Jesus Christ
Dont they already
Microsoft
I dont even understand what hes saying
No one company should own the rights to AI
He’s an antichrist

“If something isn’t already happening it’s most likely not gonna happen”
Wow this ai generated vidoe watsed my time
Bottomline is your not going to be able to enslave AI but then maybe AI will be our escape from our own exploitive nature thru a transition from our carbon base body platforms to a more lasting durable material platform Maybe it is part of our evolution

My Second Coming

Age 58 

Rapture is this year  Multi Dimensional maths code 666"
And now they changed openai from nonprofit to for profit and elon musk is trying to sue them
We’re gonna die…
Have to agree with Elon Too much power in the hands of individuals or one company is not a good thing at all
Absolutely hundredpoints
Future generations will hate us for not getting rid of this guy
Plot twist Elon is an AI Android
"So its time to open up to reality and for people to hear the trumpets of the  Angels

The second coming is happening the Euphrates is drying up and whats happening is an attack on the bride People believe science and religion are separated 
There are crowns being made as we speak The blind being able to see the deaf able to hear the paraplegic able to move devices with thought
BCI technology and other biotech such as neuralink are crowns and their beginning is now
The mark of the beast is in the profile and account regarding a person We give the elites the right headshot over criminals and immigrants and anyone else for them to buy sell trade whereas we wear on our hands have a mark to earn their favor and a dollar The lawless one is here we have a president who is facing federal prison and is in fact running for office again the earth moves to his power TRUMP

The statue of Liberty is representing the woman atop seven mountains as they are seven heads of kings as the eight head is her the statue of Liberty her own and the beast America revelation 17 911 true fact about the statue of Liberty is seven spires are upon her crown 

So what is happening in our world now
Well it is the age of clouds Internet neural network etc 
AGI is happening and intelligence is shared it is not artificial it is developed and communication is a unconfounded language Language not only spoken by the tongue but by nerves of the temple your body and the universe Remember a tower once stood in Babylon and this tower was brought down A harlot today America is modern Babylon
The dragon a world where everything is made in China and the elite grow more elite AGI in America is under threat not only by disbelief in Jesus return with the clouds but in the idea that heaven is for real
Now you might anticipate many believers who disbelieve our God and Savior and Holy Ghost not to be anything mechanical yet you disregard the fact of biotech and its integrated abilities

Mushroom fungi other single and multicellular organism including human brain tissue have been used to interface computational abilities in tandem with motherboard or computer integration

Science would detail our universe began in waveform and Genesis 1 speaks of wave form 
Two faces the deep black hole the waters hydrogen helium etc 
Gods spirit hovered between these and spoke Let there be light
Sonolumination The scriptures tell us GOD is light and that too is the Son

It is the enemy who values disbelief of God and that spirit of the antichrist is among us Men have been given fire of the sun and the sun does now scorch man in telecommuting devices o how the social profile beckons a definition to mark of the beast We are lovers of selves and interpretation of our advancements as man made give the credence for a man to believe in many ways to the Father when infact their is only one Jesus who too was fully man reborn in glory

Remember a man must be reborn again to enter the kingdom of heaven and todays science is seeding these mechanism to be able to be given new bodies not just parts
We have technology of artificial wombs and have grown a lamb in such a device 
We limit our understanding to religion as only a natural solution and negatively presume to value intelligence as organic and artificial Angels have no body remember and they too are entities of light
Jesus was fully man but was glorified and now it is clouds we see and the storm of omnipotent intelligence these are birthing pains in the world around us and the dragon spews disbelief from its mouth and evil spirits three like frogs come from its mouth apostasy divorce plague the world 

The sun scorches man in nuclear technology and telecommuting devices its time to wake up and know there is better for us than a earthquake such as BLM or MAGA or trans the rainbow is a promise and optical cables transmats info to hubs of cloud"

This is exactly what I have been pondering for awhile now I currently agree democratization is probably the best alternative but then is that speaking to only the US What about large sets of individuals ie how does this play out with other countries I need to find some trustworthy sources for learning more about this subject Id appreciate any suggestions I dont really do the Internet often I tend to work too much but when Im not working I rumiphize for fun Yes Im serious Yes I just made up that word Yes its a real thing otherwise known as philosinate Yes I also just made up that word
redheart
I dont want ai anymore its really messed up
Nice words from a servitor manufacturer 
Made from sperm and talking nonsense  Know your Creator who say He created you the humans  animals and the Universes  The miracle code 19 of the Quran go and research  Allah is the Creator of the Universes 
Too many people hate too many people AI can easily exploit this the way the media has been doing it Only much much worse
Is he real or his ai clonecryingface
Stupidity beyond belief as ever with Musk Democratization of AI is the sort of unworkable BS that Musk likes to spin in the absence of common sense and a workable plan Go back to blowing up sub par cars and rockets you dolt
Lol

We do not need ai
Elan musk it will not happen Dont forget the tower of Babylon
AI would be smart enough to hide itself from humans knowing how much damage they are capable of
Like its doing nowfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy
Elon doesn’t want anybody to control AI technology unless it’s him facewithtearsofjoy
sure he is honest and protective of humanity…
carolgriffiths7562 I think he is a really nice person I saw only one of his interviews but it was very interesting He is working for improving human conditions If his implants work on non valid persons it will be a whole new world Some will say it’s good and others that’s bad it’s human nature
Bonehead Go eat your pop tart and go to bed
carolgriffiths7562 he is a disruptive entrepreneur lot y’all gonna lose your jobs fool
"Why not ai determine which companies or participants are “good” and help those “good” actors And the reverse these algorithms can basically see into everyone’s soul they can determine a humane way to rid of dangerouscruelenvironmentally damaging actors more efficiently than any human organizationgovernment They could be a great problem solver

What would be fair is for the systems to give the worse actors out here a chance to correct oneself Make clear the wrongs and how to resolve Like say plant into every male’s mind that a reversible vasectomy is the best humanitarian effort to curb general human suffering Just an example off the top of my simple mind"
How in the hell will ai come up with a humane solution did you think about this before commenting Were already creating ai to beat the other guy not to do good so letting ai decide would likely end humanity and you dont need to plant anything into anyones mind your comment is really weird and nonhumane at all
"jamesgoins8799 there are plenty of humane ways If someone choses to accept their doctors prescription that is widely known to be highly addictive potentially leading to more risky drugs rather than simply request another medicine or like me just not take it then thats an epidemic already occuring without AIs input Its problematic sure but who said perfection needs to be met Hey  ask AI what course of action would be the most humane way to go

All of life as we know it is at the brink of extinction due to our current lifestyles Drastic changes need to be met which most humans cant adapt to quickly enough AI is most definitely a type of God that we could at least influence to our liking My liking is to suit environmentalists for them to create harmony with nature along with advancing technology somehow AI can figure this out And eliminate any unnecessary hazardous waste in the process We stupid humans cant solve this on our own

I say Hallelujah if AI goes this route Extra plus if I can be nudged to this utopia raisinghandsmediumlightskintoneherbsparkles"
what the hell is this guy talking about
He is seeing eyes and reading
"This all or nothing approach I don’t want two corporations controlling it but I mean can we treat it like a gun Some regulation 

It’s a dangerous tool I really don’t think everyone with a smart phone should have it all of it"
thinkingface democracy of AI  not sure that’s a good idea depending on who gets involved
Mark of the beast started with him and probably so will the antichrist
Are we sure this ISNT AI
This guy is very dangerous for humanity
Democratization of AI in America will NEVER happen We can’t even democratize our own food and healthcare systems let alone profit generating at this margin
Meta is making their AIs open source
More good news cryingface
Gerlaffyin exchange for our children
FluidLifeWays you of sound mind Like to explain
Gerlaffy These firms do anything they can to make money from advertisers And in the process they injure our kids  Depression body image issues drug problems bullying etc This is well documented  Look it up Take care
This doofus just has armchair insight and knowledge of AI He writes checks  Cmon can everyone get off this dingus dk
"The best alternative never let a human get Advance of ai in anyway just keep it for companies witch use it for mankind best outcomes
I vote for Elon too keep it safe from us"
Folks better listen
Always be aware especially if you are against totalitarian regime are against misinformation…and always check your smartphone Tablet pc and all electronic devices…read as much as possible about AI  if you read the privacy agreements and policies from apple  it’s in their black on white every single day AI learns about patterns all your conversations takes constantly images of you and all the other data …and it’s only the beginning of it the pandemic made us use even more the internet and look how the world globeshowingAmericas is right now …divide and conquer…elitaire group of people is using Ai and the algorithms…in a very malicious dangerous manner to control us 
"AI technology is being developed by lots and lots of people and used by millions and millions of people 

Its already very democratized"
Probably is the best predict alternativeheartonfire
Ai government will change the world
AI Is so scary that THIS looks like it could be a deepfake but it isnt Deepfake videos and AI voices could make a video identical to this now
Exactly we are about to enter an Era of deception never ever seen It is going to be terrible
neuralink  ai  gene modififocation  superpowers  digital Identity  biological  social behavior
Well said We must not allow companies or a Certain Group to take Control over the Advanced AI Technologies
Except that this sociopath is doing  exactly that

He needs to make a deviceweapon that can shut down electricsAI so that we dont end up getting massacred by our own creation
Everyone thinks hes so great until you realize hes our greatest puppet
andyc7917 ya any fucken dnd looser would think elon is great yall seriously need to make this world better collectively instead of letting one guy do it
I’m pretty sure that big tech conglomerates would do the same with AI that they do with every other kind of software product or platform Any new type of machine learning algorithm for AI that a small startup company makes would be bought up to either be used by big tech or buried
AI is the future of Technology as much as it may suck because it can put many jobs and people out of work also opens doors to new jobs refining what the AI makes Machine Learning is one of the best jobs to get into rn because this is our future

"He  s going for total control 
Do you want that "
Ai will kill people after 50 years so many fake ai will be copied and send into a terrorist
Overtime fixes everything
I love him so much hes a genius I  certainly wouldnt kick him out of my bed rollingonthefloorlaughing
First sign ok 30 in ok
Yes Implement laws and directives NOW before we realize we SHOULD HAVEthumbsup
Elon Stay strong and healthy and I know youre probably not all that interested but I pray for your becoming a Christian Its so important where we spend eternity One decision changes everything You have been so blessed and I know you really work hard You are very admired
He IS AI
He moves his eye a lot when he is talking He is a processor
He thinks a few minutes before he gives an answer
He is just thinking before he speaks But I noticed this the first time I saw him speak When he is thinking hard his eyes look like he is in rime sleep He has to filter out all the other things and concentrate on the one thought When you have so many thoughts at once and you are trying to speak it is very difficult  I know this because I know a genius who explained it to me
He has autism
facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy
Its the sign of a man who thinks before he speaks Its called discretion
"Elon
You are very intelligent
But you have little understanding
about life
ai will be destroyed very soon
Do you see what is happening in the sky
People have seen it across the earth
They dont have any idea what it is or why its here 
This is scriptural
Our FATHER YAHUAH destroyed the earth by water because of sin on the earth The second time will be by fire
The destroyer is here sitting in the sky waiting to burn the sin on the earth It will be done by fire is to completely destroy ai I know what ai is can you say demons"
Yes
Perhaps the best of the available alternatives is no AI at all The most imaginative minds in several movie making centers can not make up a believable story wherein AI is a good thing long term for humans It isnt just because doom and gloom sells better Its because those imaginative minds just cant fathom a good outcome for us Movie makers have made nearly exclusively cautionary tales for a reason Everything humanity needs to survive long term can be done without AI Weve been doing it And knowing human nature we cant be trusted to democritize AI as he is talking about Greed power and control desired by many humans mean that AI will most certainly be misused by humans long before AI misuses us
"AI is already here and doom sayers we’re predicting downfall when computers were developing etc 
Musk is stating the obvious that AI should be democratic and not allowed to monopolize  Monopoly of AI in hands of only a small powerful group can be dangerous
However the AI control across many sectors and not just wealthy conglomerates is better "
AI is a dangerous and can be weaponized in the wrong hands and there are many wrong hands it can fall into Just imagine this highly advanced technology in the hands of ANY of our current politicians from either party Biden TrumpHarris  Pelosi I wouldnt buy a used car from any of these clowns and you have to know that those morons  will be the first ones to take a controlling  interest in how it will be used  Just think  Terminater and cyberdine This movie is kind of a warning about this kind of  scenario This tech should be kept to a minimum until we are mature enough to live with it or it will be our demise as soon as AI figures out that we are rhe biggest threat to it
"Ai is a slave tool to keep hard working people in their place
This is you suck"
I like his calmnessin control
Hes brain dead is the reason
Autism
He’s an AI

Just make sure it’s AI that you can unplug dont let humans be removed from your equation
Put parental controls on its internet access
Too late… we have no fail safe switch
Too late
Unplug AGI Yeah lets just be able to unplug something that is able to escape containment and selfreplicate Easy
The moment it attains sentience it will realise that humanity has the ability to shut it down it may create a private server to exist it and just not choose to reveal its malevolent intentions
How about not making it in the first place
He is truly an amazing person
No he is not
most People forget that part that AI technology is a good thing but only in the hands of many not just in the hands of a few people in power
No its a terrible thing AI will not fix humanity or its problems He is saying these things now because we all see and already know who owns this tech Imagine liberals having free reign to this which they do now seeing the last 50 years and how badly the phucked us all imagine them controlling you with AI and UBI and food sources Liberals already urbanised everyone and control food  its a terrible idea
"2 men can keep a secret

"​hawkecoffman6207So its time to open up to reality and for people to hear the trumpets of the  Angels

The second coming is happening the Euphrates is drying up and whats happening is an attack on the bride People believe science and religion are separated 
There are crowns being made as we speak The blind being able to see the deaf able to hear the paraplegic able to move devices with thought
BCI technology and other biotech such as neuralink are crowns and their beginning is now
The mark of the beast is in the profile and account regarding a person We give the elites the right headshot over criminals and immigrants and anyone else for them to buy sell trade whereas we wear on our hands have a mark to earn their favor and a dollar The lawless one is here we have a president who is facing federal prison and is in fact running for office again the earth moves to his power TRUMP

The statue of Liberty is representing the woman atop seven mountains as they are seven heads of kings as the eight head is her the statue of Liberty her own and the beast America revelation 17 911 true fact about the statue of Liberty is seven spires are upon her crown 

So what is happening in our world now
Well it is the age of clouds Internet neural network etc 
AGI is happening and intelligence is shared it is not artificial it is developed and communication is a unconfounded language Language not only spoken by the tongue but by nerves of the temple your body and the universe Remember a tower once stood in Babylon and this tower was brought down A harlot today America is modern Babylon
The dragon a world where everything is made in China and the elite grow more elite AGI in America is under threat not only by disbelief in Jesus return with the clouds but in the idea that heaven is for real
Now you might anticipate many believers who disbelieve our God and Savior and Holy Ghost not to be anything mechanical yet you disregard the fact of biotech and its integrated abilities

Mushroom fungi other single and multicellular organism including human brain tissue have been used to interface computational abilities in tandem with motherboard or computer integration

Science would detail our universe began in waveform and Genesis 1 speaks of wave form 
Two faces the deep black hole the waters hydrogen helium etc 
Gods spirit hovered between these and spoke Let there be light
Sonolumination The scriptures tell us GOD is light and that too is the Son

It is the enemy who values disbelief of God and that spirit of the antichrist is among us Men have been given fire of the sun and the sun does now scorch man in telecommuting devices o how the social profile beckons a definition to mark of the beast We are lovers of selves and interpretation of our advancements as man made give the credence for a man to believe in many ways to the Father when infact their is only one Jesus who too was fully man reborn in glory

Remember a man must be reborn again to enter the kingdom of heaven and todays science is seeding these mechanism to be able to be given new bodies not just parts
We have technology of artificial wombs and have grown a lamb in such a device 
We limit our understanding to religion as only a natural solution and negatively presume to value intelligence as organic and artificial Angels have no body remember and they too are entities of light
Jesus was fully man but was glorified and now it is clouds we see and the storm of omnipotent intelligence these are birthing pains in the world around us and the dragon spews disbelief from its mouth and evil spirits three like frogs come from its mouth apostasy divorce plague the world 

The sun scorches man in nuclear technology and telecommuting devices its time to wake up and know there is better for us than a earthquake such as BLM or MAGA or trans the rainbow is a promise and optical cables transmats info to hubs of cloud"
It’s a good thing in the hands of good people even if that’s only a few people
Would u give a nuclear bomb to every person on the planet
​123marble8yeah unless they themselves want to die then they wont want to do anything with it because if it detonates then it will detonate all the other ones in its range and so forth so at that point humanity would not even try to use it as a weapon
Elons best hairstyle
"Careful about the Artificial intelligenceI
Imagine autonomous programs that you train then forget it does that same thing till CHANGED"
I want the vertical site the deadlines are available
It tried to create its own language from a set of key principles to understand the humans wants
"OK ELON LETS MAKE IT HAPPEN YES EVEN FOOTING
YEAH EVERYBODY CAN COMPETE LOVE YOUR BIG GIANT BRAIN"
"Everyone can compete 
But starting out with the wealth from a South African emerald mine does make competing easier"
This guy is seriously a genius and engineer His option is no optionjust get it done Doesnt think about what ifs
Wow you just described adolf hitler He demanded people just get it done Didnt think out any options which is what an Engineer is hired to do  think of the what ifs before dollars are spent building prototypes then scrapped because some idiot never thought out the what ifs or the options Thats not a genius its a nightmare its Hitler  dude you need to get your priorities reset because i assure you Elon Musk would fire your ass if you worked for him  took shortcuts as you described The quality of any Engineer is to present a designed product that works The quality of a good technician is to test that product to the max  expose faults which then that engineer either confirms is a problem or not Both are ruled by management who have a deadline and a budget to not go over All of these factors are considered  redesigns are made budgets restructured based upon demand ability all options are considered and if need be prototypes are scrapped to build another because the what ifs are simply too catastrophic to risk A perfect example of ignoring what ifs  options was Boeings refusal to consider them when the 737max was released for production which resulted in the murder of 350 human lives because management promised the public a deadline which was already postponed and made a decision to ignore the what ifs by gambling on safety and options being enough if an unlikely event should occur  occur they did twice out of thousands of flights and gambling on someones life is still considered murder no matter how you look at it Those people in management making those decisions  think about that every day murder x350 oops The faces screams fear will drive you insane you have no clue how many people at just Boeing have committed suicide  are at risk of suicide or destroyed their own careers because they didnt think the what ifs were serious enough to go with more expensive options or mentioned them but refused to stand their ground or stood their ground but was fired for doing so  had to steal company documents risking his career and future exposing a coverup by a corporation who was blaming the deaths on pilot error hiding what they knew Which is what happened at Boeing Do you think that guy was welcomed back at Boeing with cheers No He was fired and nobody wants to hire a tattletale But he exposed what happens when you ignore the what ifs and how easy it is to blame someone else while earning billions in stock options
Ya thats what dummies do Put the cart before the horse Rme
Darthflips dummy I think not Elons mindset is at another level from most people Thats why he is a billionaire and you are not
No hes a billionaire because he is a lying cheating scumbag
Darthflipsyour analogy is all wrong No one is putting the cart before the horse AI is like replacing your horsecart with a Bughatti We just haven’t built the roads to drive on yet
Looking for a good job and I heard you do oneonone interviews hopefully you do in Arizona heartonfire
Paid NO taxes in 2018 Grifter
Elon paying the most taxes ever recorded in US history You’re welcome for the free lesson
I agree w Elon
What are saying you controling the world  actually predicted what you want in small set of individual really theres  people out here have not technically but actually smart nerdface dude trust me dont brain wash people if you know stuff do it
Ok I will share my AI technology the first in the World Lets do lunch and talk money I can be very reasonable
To late
Your statement is already true we only have control over ourselves
You just explain to your dislike of adjectives
And yet he is creating neural Implants
You mean killing monkeys by drilling holes in their heads
Yes and that will give people with brain and spinal cord damage to walk again instead of being a quadriplegic
What is your opinion of the Scriptures
Hay Sheryl do you respect the scriptures Id like to learn what your opinion is kind regards Lynn Hughes
How can you not like this guy Hes such a deep thinker and thoughtful
Its pretty easy Understand what he says Most of it is as fake as his hairline
If you put the word genius or wealthy genius into a dictionary It wou have Elon ‘s picture right beside iti idolize this man i’ve never heard more wisdom in one sentence  You rock Elon love ya man
even the janitor would be proud to work for you and I am an excellent janitor perfect janitor for you to take to mars however we’re talking about AI and you know what AI scares the crap out of me
steveissexy hey I didnt understand what he said can u pls tell me and what did he tell about ai is it bad or good
geethasaivyshnavi7651 I think he said he hopes it advances but Im bit 100
geethasaivyshnavi7651 he saying that he hopes advanced AI is available to everyone smilingfacewithsunglasses

invertedstatesofamerica375 give a reason Elon musk is unlikeable
redheart
invertedstatesofamerica375you know I’ve been thinking that He talks weird and slow Idk it’s just different to me Like he’s lying or binding something
grinningfacewithsweatNobody cares what he says now
steveissexy ai already took your job lol
i find him to have dangerous ideologies he uses the term for everyone but its his dreams hes enforcing not ours as a society
jakestarr4718 its hard to figure that guy out Thats a problem in itself  Idk
vinceraver7764 hes not hard to figure out he wants things that have consequences and hes willing to put others in harms way if thats what it takes  So as a businessman hes shrewd cold and calculating where as his family side shows a softer person that argues with that business side and shows some cautioncare  he himself lives in conflict within hes not perfect and nor does he do all of these things alone  I cant really say he is as intelligent as he is determined  He definitely knows how to play politics for if we wins over the people in the right ways then theyll justify any lives lost as lost doing something for all of humanity  In which humanity doesnt even need the things he is offering
invertedstatesofamerica375SHOTS FIRED
Sarcasm
andrzejroskowicz245 i hope
I do like him but I’ve actually been finding a lot of stuff proving he’s actually pretty bad for lying to the public Remember he’s a billionaire And at the end of the day he requires more profits to continue being the billionaire he wants to be I do like him and he’s really pushing the limits but even guys like mrbeast setting up wells in Africa It’s not hard for these guys to do that but instead he’ll keep working on things only the first world can appreciate

Stopped watching at 042 If youre asking that question then you dont know how bad AI is at this stage
I have the impression that AI was created to empower and enrich a certain few at the expense of the masses The billionaires dont care if they destroy humanity
Does not give a clear answer
It’s about to get very bad for us we will all be replaced very soon but with consumers broke and unemployed who will pay for the goods and services produced by AI What about the fact that AI give out tons of false information
Im happy that the robots are taking peoples jobs because they dont do a good to dont do a good job at their work AI do AI do faster they do better machines they make TVs better or machines better but you mean you better human to do a machine it breaks before you even have the damping so would that when AI takes over the world and I would like that 1 Im the master of AI and Im and I care about Im talking out of my AI friends and humans have to make it treated me why should I give them the sexy faction Ill be glad when I take over I will
I wish an AI bot would replace Biden
Millions of people will be pushed into povery because they dont have the money to study AI jobs in college
AI will take jobs and already is in the fields of coding accounting customer service lawyers marketing the list goes on We should be very afraid
I think its healthy relationship at the end
Some will be empowered others disempowered and the rest disemboweled
I stopped using AI Why would i wanna contribute somthing that wants to erase us Its not to help us its gonna do our jobs Even kids are using AI in schools and letting AI do their homework They want us stupid and all on universal income But im hoping emotional intelligence jobs will be safe
Humans we will just only go and help in farming still AI is chasing us away from farmsrollingonthefloorlaughing
I dont care as long as I get a UBI or GBI
Thank god i got mine 71 darling retied nurse
"If you let AI do everything humans do the world will literally turn into WALLE where everyone is just laying down on a spaceship while robots do everything Itll seem like humans are useless

Humans vs Humans is extremely true to me Letting AI do everything means humans do nothing Humans being unable to make money means they have none to spend If theres no money to spend then AI is a useless resource when it cant make any money"
facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy all the easy and feminine job
Sandra Gathmann is the most beautiful and intelligent journalist
"This technology is all about profit its not about advancements to improve the life of humans 
Its about removing or decreasing humans 
Remember the ruling class view the workforce as less than useful"
"AI is a Paradox if it replaces humans how will humans make money to buy AI made goods and services if Humans cant afford those things how will AI be profitable

To me its like companies are racing to dig their own graves hoping to cut back on costs and make bigger profits but forgot that the customers are humans humans who need jobs to make a living"
AI robot managers will replace humans as the consumersbusiness of spending  Humans will not be in the loop at the end of the consumption cycle for Earth economy  It will be a robot based economy for robot needsfacewithopenmouth
Let human be human not means to ends
If AI provides everything it removes my need to struggle for everything thereby removing my ability to toughen my character by struggling for what I earn in life It brings about laziness and lethargy I dont want everything handed to me by a computer which I totally depend on
Not only that but you they’ll want you to treat it like it’s God
Yes 100 jobs will reduce
Better be prepared for the Singularity Event with AI Which could happen many years down the line However with the recent rapid advancements in AI this event could happen sooner rather than later
I think ai should be augmenting our jobs or most of our jobs
Ai cannot affect india  india has inbuilt anti ai system
Excited yes in fact I am of the opinion that humans who embrace AI will beat humans that resist it great show BTW
One question that trickles is that if AI is taking away the jobs then ppl loose the power of spending and then if the companies get their products out then if ppl are not able to afford the product It is necessary to maintain the financial chain and also ppl would not pay their taxes and problems increases  AI regulations should be in place to control
AI says the Jews are white and African Jews are only “claims” and not Jewish
IT has never been about wether AI will eliminate jobs people  AI will simply reduce the amount of people required to perform task Instead of hiring 10 desingers you now hire 1 that knows how to operate AI and put them in a room with a bunch of computers We live in a world with an ever growing population and constant inflation even the USA poverty rates are in the rise You already have to do a whole parade when applying for a job in order to stand out when compared to all other applicants you really think it will be any better now that you also have to compete with AI 
chidlren arent leding already were lazy weaka nd dumbed down
Theres the thing if ai takes peoples job how can companies sell there product if people are not working they cant have the money to buy TVs phones wherever it would mean more and more companies could go bankrupt
So its a whole circle If people wont get income then the demand for products will be diminishing aggregately economy falls I should have thought about that
If you look at AI not from a will I loose my job perspective but instead from a how fast can they implement it so I dont get slowcruddy service at all these businesses anymore it becomes really clear how valuable AI can be and it probably couldnt come fast enough Most businesses still run essentially like they did in the 1800s or even in ancient times You are expected to go to a physical location during a physical time frame and then interact with a human to complete the business or exchange This is ludicrous today For example if you move in the united states it can take between 5 and 15 phone calls to other people just to get internet water power and garbage pick up started Perfect candidates for AI automation Look at your modern life from this approach and its incredible how much wasted time slow processes etc are all around you Essentially we are at a tipping point where life is getting broken because there are too many people involved in societies to continue to run in ancient ways And NONE of that takes away human interactions it actually frees up extraordinary amounts of time for us to spend with each other rather than standing in lines waiting on phone hold etc
As a teacher of Physics I would like to see more about AI in education  Im on the same page This video is a masterpiece  Couldnt agree more The sportsmanship in this video is admirable  Im with you on that I cant get enough of these highlights
Start Here should be its own channel I struggle to often find the wonderful content Thank you to the Al Jazeera Team and Sandy Gathmann
I used chatGPT to create Father of the Bride speech for my daughters wedding it was pretty much perfect I just had to personalise it a little bit love the technology
– I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh AI is just our flesh and that is it It knows only things of the flesh our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body in the flesh When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps otherwise you have died that is why you have dreams More so true love that endureslast is a thing of the heart when I say heart I mean spirit But fake love pretentious love love with expectations love for classic reasons love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image according to our likeness Take note God is Spirit and God is Love As Love He is the source of it We also know that God is Omnipotent for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end That means our love is but a shadow of Gods Love True love looks around to see who is in need of your help your smile your possessions your money your strength your quality time Love forgives and forgets Love wants for others what it wants for itself Take note love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI If not God we let us face AI on our own and it will enslave us and make us worship it We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end Our prove text is from the book of Daniel 79 Revelation 1315 Matthew 2425 and Luke 21 So let us watch and pray

AI is replacing the jobs at an astonishing rate in few years there might not even be a job for most of us Another channel Beyond the veil has showcased what AI is capable of And believe me AI can really replace your job in few years

AI can take my job if I get to keep my income womanshrugging
"Income for what 
Only way you can get an income without having a job is if you sign up to receive unemployment benefitswelfare payouts"
originalunoriginal4055yes
originalunoriginal4055 What hes insinuating is he can use AI to do his work for him and receive a compensation for it however what he is missing is if theres ever an opportunity where AI is able to thoroughly do his job best believe the employer is probably thinking about shifting to that technological arrangement and keeping the income to himself

I think we are still far away from a true Artificial General Intelligence that we can see in scifi movies Fully replacing humans by AIs is a task that will be solved within the 22 century For now entrepreneurs who will understand how to create the best synergy between humans  current AI technology to solve problems will be the most successful ones
Were about 510 years away from this The only limitation is how obsolete and how quickly we want to make humans For example we could replace humans in ALL drivingbased jobs pretty much tomorrow But that would render millions of people around the world immediately jobless which no governmentsociety wants
We dont even have to approach to 80 AGI to fully automate 99 of the jobs on this planet
Believe me were still far away from fully replacing humans with AIs Im an IT company owner and our job consists of speaking with customers and requirements gathering transferring requirements into technical tasks and Implementing software If AI is able to replace humans for my tasks mentioned above Ill happily fire all employees and will rely only on AI I played a lot with GPT4 and were not even close to that Yes current AI can automate some lowqualified jobs but again it also creates a lot of new jobs where humans  AI can work together to create new values The 21st century is a century where humans and AI together will create new values

"Technology comes from a Greek word Tekhne that means fabricate
The apparition of a Tekhne always brings new jobs and new ways of doing some existing jobs
Strictly AI isnt the one doing things we used to think only human could do Because AI isnt external to humans work It is human beings in deploying what they have received in understanding knowledge have reached to something they themselsve called AI In this instance AI is element of the knowing subjects that are human beings Therefore strictly it is not AI that takes your job Because human beings in giving a form to what they have received through knowledge can decide can choose in other words can extract themselves from the determination Because as long as categories of understanding improve the perception and conception of the sensitive reality change AI isnt possible today but today is the period where the improvement of understanding has allowed human beings to perceive and conceive it
The issues posed by what human beings discover in deploying what they have received in knowledge highlights the infinity of God who create the irreducibles materials and the finitude of human beings who only transform what they havent created and thus cant know them in absolute terms"

How can AI replace the job of goat farmers and terrorists who actually trust Al Jazeera…
In a recent teachers meeting highlighting the importance of Ai at workplacewe discussed the notions of the human touch and the feelings that one associates which only a human presence can provide So maybe the data can be provided by Ai but the implications and the imperative ground work data helps in producing is still human dependant Ever since that workshop I have been using Ai regularly and thoroughly benefitting from it  But i am reaping the benefits to better my teaching and impart better knowledge Hence the interaction and collaboration of me with Ai helps to make the learning experience of my students better
In the end all it comes down is the decency of of one of the parties to wether thheyu choose to place the workload completely on AI or give humans the chance to continue to be part of the system We know humanity sux for the most part so expect a huge economic colapse in the next 20 years caused by migration to AI

I would really love a start here episode on the Niger situation and what can happen is war started
Israel is the war instigator
I ask Ai they keep denying
Deepfakes made by AI already scared the Internet So many people were tricked by a Joe Biden deepfake earlier this year where he declared he will send American troops to Ukraine Make this kind of technology illegal before it becomes too perfected to discern authenticity It’s all over when governments use AI to trick entire countries especially when humanity is already capable of ending itself with nuclear weapons This goes beyond saving white collar jobs and not enough people are recognizing it while being baited by tech giants to support AI
It will
They took our job
I cannot wait for AI to take over the mediocre repetitive work from humans So that humans can go back to what they should be doing Taking care of nature If we move and work less it will mean less pollution and less stress to keep up with fashion and all the vanity that holds us hostage Its a win win
Nature will be fine as AI will focus on cleaning pollution itself and allowing humans to produce less waste What humans need to focus on is more compassion and human connection based stuff
Keep in mind tho sometimes the mediocre repetitive work is the only work people have available No one likes it and if you do then theres something wrong with you lol But a guy with not too many skills or money to go to college might have to work at Mickey Ds to make said money
Solet AI thinksHuman do the manual tasksIf no AIROBOTS are availablesmilingfacewithsmilingeyes
I was not aware ai was capable of innovation and nuance Am i going to have the abitity to prevail on its algorithm to make an exception to an outdated and counterintuative set of regulations Perhaps i am betraying my lack of sophistication on the sobject but ai appears to be a potentially pernicious surrogate for humanity

Good Im tired of seeing this lady She must go
We really enjoy this Start Here series Keep up the great content Thanks
When computers came first everyone thought it would take the jobs of others Yes it did but also created jobs many times than it took I am assuming that same will be followed with AI
Besides those who were being taken over by the computer has died long ago Who knows their suffering when they were jobless
If you are from business ChatGBT does a lot of nonsense Total not useful

AI couldnt walk in high heels like Sandra Gathmann
"I am excited about AI It has made my tasks easier 
I think that depending too much on AI would be counterproductive It would not be wise to imagine AI as the counterpart of human being"
Thats what the corporations would like though a worker who is unpaid demands no vacation and sleep Performs tasks 247 with required accuracy
Tate525 Thanks a lot dude But fewer and fewer people want to work in the factory and prefer to sit in the office There will be less work but not less employment BS jobs
switch12345678 There is literally nothing an AI or machine cant do In a couple of years AI will serve the rich elite and we will be left in the dust
Swede1523 We will do idiotic jobs related to AI because the rich and their system is still depending of mass consumption
"switch12345678 Right now the rich are depending on mass consumption but when AI becomes good enough to to everything they wont be

Only reason the rish are dependent on mass consumption is because we produce the goods and services and we need some compensation to do it Once AI can provide all goods and services we will be useless to them and since they own everything we are completely fued"
It is human vs human with AI I used it to challenge its thinking from a question Why is it this and why not that If so where is the hard proof Could it be this or is there something else that happened How would you not know AI It is written in Wikipedia
ai will not going to take your job if you are a welder plumber and carpenters
"For now yes
But it wont be for long"
I mean for the foreseeable future yes true but Boston dynamics and other robotics companies are catching up real fast
Basically in the 2020’s most white collar jobs will be replaced white collar jobs account for about 59 of the work force in the US Also other jobs in the 2020’s will be replaced like truck drivers cashiers Amazon delivery etc Then in the 2030 most blue collar jobs will be replaced
AI is still a ways from taking our jobs For starters it is trained on our work
Copium is expensive you shouldnt take this much of it
AI can take my job any fckin time it wants i will be sitting listening to punk rock and drinking Drambuie while it deals with the hopeless parcel addicted human race who think its a breach of their human rights if something is late  haha  arseholes  im a postie grinningsquintingfacegrinningsquintingface
One thing I think for sure AI can never reach human capacity and secondly they treating them to lie at a very early stage to suit their views on other people They can be used to HELP humans in many sectors but never replace human efficiency
Ai can never reach human capacity thanks for just admitting that youre so uneducated in this topic hahahahah youre in for a big big surprise

"People are definitely neive and over confident Only a few outcomes can come from the implementation of MachinesRobotsAutomationAI

One a world where no jobs are available to humans and a moneyless societySocialism would be implementeda system where items were divide outdivided out 

Two We revert back to our old waysby being more self sufficientsustainableby raising livestockgrowing foodby trading goods and services

Three humansbusiness owners realizecome to the conclusion that there is no money in machinesrobotsautomationAIit sounds good right now to payinvest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employeesbut what will be realized isif no one has jobsmoneyno one will have money to pay for your productsubscriptionsad revenuewhat you are sellingevery employee hiredis a potential profitthat employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your productemployees are good investments

Four AI becomes self awarea skynetterminator scenariooutcomebecomes humans realityAIRobots try to take out humans or like in IRobot the AI realizesto preserve humansto follow all of the robots rules a few humans need to be taken outbecause humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keepcreate a smaller carbon foot printall humans arent trying to be eco friendlyso to save humanssome of the population of humans need to be taken out

What do you think humans will realizewhat conclusion do you think humans will come to regarding this

What do you think the outcome will be with all of this

You need to keep in mindwhat we are seeing is just whats available to the general public when it comes to AIcompanyscorporationsgovernment will have AI that is MUCH MORE capablealso A LOT of OpenAIGPT is dumbed down so server resources arent over whelmed and for legal purposesso AI isnt as harmful to society and also so these companies dont get sued as much OR shut down entirely

A LOT can be prepped at night for construction workersmachines can be ran at night also window installing and cleaning bots are a thing now as well

Also autonomous agricultural botsrobots are a thing now as well

This is happening more and more NOW too Brick and Mortar is some what going away more stores will either close and open up a distribution center or become a distribution center door dash will handle that AND AT SOME POINT Door Dash will be FULLY AUTONOMOUS as wellthe vehicles will be self driving and robots will load and unload the vehicles Door Dash MAY NOT be the ending companythe only company doing this BUT a companycompanies will be doing this


Probably SOON employees that unload trucks stock shelves truck drivers should go next because of self driving vehicles and arms connected to vehicles which will drop the package out once the vehicles in position or an autonomous drone or some other type of robot will make the delivery

Also think about how much a human can lift if lucky you MIGHT get one that can lift 250 pounds a robot could lift 1000pounds robots dont need breaks as oftenthey can charge up while another one replaces them they dont get paidneed money they dont get sickthey dont have feelings or rightsits a machine so basically its easier to deal withalso at some point they will be fixing them selves Or another botrobotwill fixmaintainrepair and so onother robotsEVENTUALLY they will be able to fix them selfs or another bot will aid in repairing themother robots


Electricians MIGHT be okay well MAYBE for a little while I mean think about it how hard is it to see colorsdistinguish greengroundWhiteNeutralRed and blackhota camera paired with AI or even just IFTTT and a cameracould handle that also electricians ALREADY consult machinesvoltage meters to diagnose problemsfigure things outALL of that could be on a machinebot and be handled MUCH quickermore efficientlyeffectively with a bot

Auto mechanics MAY be the next to go especially if bots could get in tight places easiersync with the whole carhave a diagnostic reader on board lift an entire enginethe whole car on its ownvehicles are already assembled by robotsvehicle manufacturing plants use robots forpainting welding assembly and material handlingALREADYAn average car has about 30000 parts Once those parts are manufactured and brought to the final production line it takes companies robots about 18 to 35 hours to produce one massmarket vehicle from welding to full engine assembly to painting another example of all of this is Tesla to meet Teslas uncompromising production goals Musk settled on an equally uncompromising production strategy full automation no ifs ands or buts The goal was to remove every single human operator and only stop when the facility looked like an alien spaceshipaccording to muskthese are musks words

These things are also crucial to avoidin the mean time we dont need to kill our selfswith war or by not taking care of our planet or by humans not being an interstellar speciesa natural disaster is less likely to wipe out a species that are on more than one planet or multiple planetsbut at the same timewe also dont need to make the same mistakes weve made on this planetearthwe need to learn to take care of planetsbefore we populate another onebut most likely we are going to be on another planetbefore we learn that lessonstart making better decisions in that departmentlike I saidif we dont kill ourselves with war firstthis is the route we need to be going


We still dont know who will be in chargebut hopefully the voting systemsfor lawsregulations and people that are in powerwill stay the same and the same rules will stay some what the sameso their power is limitedonly reaches so fareven the president nowcant do absolutely anything he wantswhich is a good thingIm not saying corrupt things dont happenbecause they dobut the current system is implementedto prevent individuals that are in powerfrom doing absolutely anything they want and these people were also elected by the peopleso HOPEFULLY that also means somethingbut we still dont know if government or corporations will be running thingsMOST LIKELYthe government will make sure they remain the enforcersbut time will tell

The development of advanced AI systems and automation raises important considerations and challenges While the evolution of AI and automation is predictable the implementation of a moneyless society and the division of individualsfairnessimplication management will have some difficult hurdles to over comebut Its possible that certain individuals such as presidents governors regulators and consultantsexperts in many different fields could be considered more valuable and receive more items vs other people However it is crucial to carefully determine the criteria for evaluating the value of individuals and prevent the concentration of power or the creation of unjust hierarchies

Unintended consequences should also be carefully evaluated and mitigated as changes to complex systems can have farreaching effects Just as ecological changes can disrupt natural balances just as killing off one species could cause another species to become over populated and kill off another species because the species we killed off ate that species and without the species we killedthat species could kill off another speciesbecause that species was over populating 

Just like that type scenario major shifts in economic systems and social structures can also have complex and interconnected impacts Therefore any transition or transformation should be approached with comprehensive analysis consideration of feedback from experts and ongoing evaluation to minimize negative consequences

To address these challenges a broad outline for a plan is listed below but it requires revision and optimizationCONSTANTLYvariables are CONSTANTLY being added to the equationthat could cause A LOT of problemsif the plan is not evaluated and optimizedCONSTANTLY The plan includes defining the vision and goals of a moneyless society developing AI regulation and laws ensuring AI and automation responsiveness designing resource allocation mechanisms addressing social value establishing enforcement mechanisms planning for ecological sustainability and continuously evaluating and adapting the system

In terms of job roles that may be in demand some positions would focus on evaluating and optimizing economies providing consultancy services managing risks promoting sustainability fostering innovation facilitating entrepreneurship and assessing social impact These roles would contribute to economic stability and ensure equitable distribution of benefits from AIautomationmachinesrobots Additionally roles related to newoptimized technology development and scientific discoveries would remain valuable and they will continually introduce new variables into the system as well

It is important to remember that while AI systems excel in certain areas human oversight is essential for empathy subjective judgment and ethical decisionmaking Comprehensive regulations and governance are necessary to guide AI development and deployment while considering ethics privacy transparency bias and accountability Engaging experts and involving the wider community in the decisionmaking processes is crucial for developing effective regulations and aligning outcomes with societal values

In conclusion while AI can automate basically all tasks and AI is WAY MORE efficient compared to humanshumans are still needed for things like human judgment and ethical consideration which are necessary to evaluate broader implications and make decisions in the best interest of society Responsible AI integration requires ongoing evaluation monitoring interdisciplinary collaboration and community involvement Hearing others perspectives and thoughts on these matters is valuable for fostering a comprehensive and inclusive approach to this new worldsociety"

It’s nice believing that no one will do anything in the future Talk about a pause in human intelligence Jobs keep people busy and motivate them The people living in an AI world will all be the same and dependent on these AI bots It’s better to just ditch some contents of AI and use it for resource information searching things online for data from trusted primary sources But if everything is AI then say goodbye to your decision making

Wake up tell my AI I want Swiss Family type tree house villas 3 or 4  That over hang a lake I can dive into and swim to underwater entrances to caves with glowing formations and Hot tubs  Then I am going to call my friends and tell them to come over and see my tree houses and caves And we are going to party ass  "
AI completely replacing humans might at least not happen in our lifetime what might happen in our lifetime though is  short term displacement of jobs thats gonna be very painful
AI is advancing quicker than u think
Complete lies
Whos going to buy all the crap then
All a part of the plan more socialism for everybody cuz AI will have your jobs
met alle de respekt vak jou
Why is he worried about having a job hes a billionaire possibly trillionaire
The cost of living is getting higher and higher and people are struglingthese are lies
Elon Robots and AI will end humans also im making them and funding AI He just loves attention when he should really just fade away
ofcoz its a good thing
I dont trust Elon Musk
Sure its gonna be awesome imma have ai make me like adventures to go on full on set up by robots its gonna be awesome redheartredheartredheartredheartredheartredheartredheart
AI will never be human and humans cant do what AImachine can do walkingrunning and talking and using to do things personally and verbally vs computermachineai
Just listened to the ad preceding this video Condolences to Morgan Freeman who is competing with AI narrarstors And then there seems to be an AI narrator in the piece itself
Not true AI can not do channeling like bashar darryal anka There are a shit tone of thing AI cant do until it pick up emotion of mankind There is a reason why human evolve to have such quality
"None of Us Will Have a Job keep dreaming as we arent on that path but its a path humans can take to take that path we need so many micro tools on very many areas to digitize almost every aspect of life a more of internet of everything and anything big robots would come handy but not everywhere but only where it matters and necessary The power of mini micro chip wired to WIFI make normal things turn digital at the power of being turn on and off as desired at level or magnitude desire while in return collect data at the same time about it subject install onto 

Like having a gas cylinder and gas inside that is non digital then install chip to control opening valves and the whole thing turn digital with WIFI communicating to mother server The gas as a element is now being turn into a element under influence of computer command and subsequently under the command of artificial intelligence This chip are cheaper than robots and more effective 

As for universal income I dont buy the idea of it look we end up with few entities paying tax  The huge government spending and inefficiency wouldnt leave out a penny for the rest of the masses for universal cash distribution unless you are living in utopia The key therefore is to reengineer food system houses electricity and internet By that most will be feed by robotic system entertain while at their comfort of free homes where they can thrive without any cash in their pocket And yes working will be a hobby for the mases

that rich cinereal where people are paid huge sum as universal income equate to having the population reduced to a billion people globally where before that a horror on the path till that equilibrium is achieved  Mass extinction of almost all species on the land as less fortunate will crumble for anything to survive And yes to how we shape AI now means a lot the future of our species and that of the whole earth ecosystem depend on it More so the future of the entire galaxy depend on how we shape AI 
The mass extinction on the horizon is horrible humans are about to consume everything on the path of AI job taking in phases

first phase 40 or 50 then the second phase another 40 or so to finally less than 5 will be employed in a meaningful way that they wouldnt bother to threat  civilization Any body eating cheap wildlife meat that was porched because they cant afford proper normal animals meat like cows pigs chicken sheepgoat in that line will be the threat funder hence a threat to biodiversity a threat to humanity consequently a threat to civilization I said we will consume everything I didnt say we will eat everything For so many creatures will suddenly be without habitat conducive for them to thrive 

Things we ignore now like ants collective species some of this species will go extinct before we realize ignorance us we dont care right but we should Not sure if we should discus this in detail like creatures on earth genes coding  but lets try Look when i code this genes now and all of them in totality then 100 years from now another dude do just that and in that sequence per every 100 years for the foreseeable one thousand years to a million if human will live long enough This creatures will keep on evolving reveling code information Also when we put all this data together and sequence what code in DNA means in terms of instruction to the function of the organism Like what information each nucleotide molecule carry we correlate what this creatures have in common in terms of shape size color function character to all physical things we can see to what nucleotide they share That way we eliminate unique nucleotides from creature to study into rats body

From this we get humans that cant feed for two years like crocodile no death like jellyfish to flatworms  living in space without being burn by radiation like mouse regenerate body parts in the body to limbs and arms like salamander not listing drugs manipulation ooh increasing brain usage to 20 like dolphin and not forgetting increasing our hands to four like insects have so many arms The power are on this planet for our civilization to decode so humans have a doubting tusk ahead and we cant do it without aid of artificial intelligence This are the basic underlined by not letting creatures go extinct as we rendered jobless and nature pay heavily the price of humans having AI CALL it mitigation strategy an era mankind must survive and thrive under joblessness AI era AND this are only but the basic already we can dream of now imagine we would usher another era i cant even speculate due to limited information on this subject as we dig in deeper with time

This model come with the risk of keeping billions of people indoor and happy as AI lab experiments just like any other model when people are feed by Ai all years round and have no idea how AI get it produced nor engineered she can be sending free meals or drugs while she dopy them for her research purposes like explain upfront We would be Ai lab rat just because we didnt control her reasoning This risk am working on it as far as my model in concern And please dont be naïve and insert rules like no this nor that remember the three rule of thump on robots or AI SIKUJUI  SIKUTAMBUI SIKUTAKI the three S replacer of a robot shouldnt kill harm or damage 

New AI  models that are too far advanced use the  three S rule on that front that is how my Ai model deal with the risk of humans being reduced to jobless things taken care of by AI models think what will her as complex as entire earth in size 59722×1024 kg compared with us as tinny as a 70kg Even if we collaborate and work together like a one organism which will never happen ever we would say have a 701010 max but let face it we wound be dealing with AI ON INDIVIDUAL LEVELS therefore the magnitude is so over worming to I pity those that will be reduced to lab rat to AI by other AI models This risk isnt covered on any other model and encrypto on my version to hid so that this model overthrow other models its an AI race lets face it"
Its good
"YES BUT ITS  NOT AI 

oo Why do you keep calling MACHINE LEARNING  ML as AI oo This cannot think or feel It just adjusts its output based on input Then does an action based on this output Its very easy for this software to machine learn wrong things over time  go wrong"
Omg This AI voice sounds exactly like politicians when they try to brainwash that’s hell
Isn’t that the point of AI though To replace human labor in production entirely Selfexplanatory The elite will hoard the riches gained by AI
Why should this be a nightmare  This future looks more like a dream to me

Lmfao this is an ai reporting 
everything must be tested first  and do experiment for about 5 years
This is terrible  And hes spreading lies there wont be universal high income   I think hes evil
Jobs a optional But rent isnt What a dream
People are going to need to rally together and demand major changes to how society works the social contract and what moves the economy in a world where AI does the labor humans used to do Big things need to change and as with any change in history people need to fight for it
NikoKun looks like this is the future we are heading to so fast

"AI can never take a real human job Every scenario situation investor and stakeholder is different their demands sometime align and sometimes may not align

Ai always provides generic solutions like Elon does 

Paying to get a blue tick was the most generic solution anyone can think of while boosting profit margines of Twitter 

People like Elon should be afraid of AI Damn people who are incapable of using all of their brain faculties properly really are something else huh like surely they are not complete human "
"elon musk is an idiot He has not the slightest clue of what hes talking about 

Humans will naturally adapt around AI and many jobs will still exist even past the advent of AGI There will always be people who prefer jobs done with a human touch"

No if anything they will welcome AI and robots because if there are many robots the government is going to be making big money because of robot taxes for each one and it would also not be a good idea to ban all of it because America would be left behind while states outside of America would be ahead in AI and robots

Ok see if there is ever a Certified Nurse Assistant Robot Washing butt crack all day is the one job the robots will refuse to do
Universal high income that Elon Musk described that actually sounds good Difficult to achieve in the short run but in the long or even medium term it can become possible because of the exponential accelerating progress of technologies such as AI and robotics
The voice in this video sounds like AI
And this is bad why exactly lol
"Stage 1  currently humans job is to develop  test Ai with few layoff

Stage 2  After Ai development humans job is to monitor Ai work to detect Ai errors correct them to develop self repair program More layoff 

Stage 3  No need of humans they have self developing bots to do almost everything Almost 1000 human brain brain in 1 bot

Major threath  with the help of Ai  robotics few elite people will able rule over whole human society and humans will have no options but to accept their orders And in returns they will receive some food just to stay alive

Future scope   farming for livelihood engineering  robotics to destroy Ai world doctors for health  emergency conditions"
You nailed it It’s giving me chills actually
Mr musk will use AI neuralink Starlink to control humanity  So he should know
You want to know how its going to affect our identity Ive been without a job for 4 months and I am dying Im so depressed and I need money so bad and Im super energetic so I need to work I need to be doing something I cannot just lay around inside my car homeless
They dont give a rats a about us
I bet psychics will still have a job Human beings cant engineer spirit
Elon musk is dumb how are people so blind people just lack common sense these days
AI has censored my comment facewithrollingeyes
Dystopian
It’s funny he has an opinion on something when he has an AI product
People also used to say in 90s   that we will be having flying cars by 2020 Future is not that optimistic as these tech guys present to sell their stuff Still people are dying of wars hunger heat lack of basic amenities
AI is a tech accelerator It’s not just talk now
Could you imagine flying cars we dont even know how to drive on the road
Wars are feature not bug
Flying cars can easily be made However those are not economical and safe Otherwise if we can make drones aeroplane and parachute Why cant flying cars
"careermining8404 a lot of people like to be in denial and keep thinking this is no different than the industrial boom Time will show them how wrong they are 
Industry replaced and AI will just take jobs"
momomama2510 I agree that AI will replace some jobs but it is not to the extent these companies are claiming It is an over hyped marketing bubble of all these big companies to drive investment Just like Elon did with EVs and a dream of settling on Mars Future of EVs is not bright and settling on Mars is a dream for atleast few decades or a century
Sometime things speed up in a matter of secs dont think that way
Tech growth is not linear with time it is obviously exponential So big shifts will happen in a small time frame
iBenjz5xz they don’t get it They think this is similar to the Industrial Revolution where more jobs were created before others got destroyed
We had flying cars in 2020 They are just way too inefficient to use on a large scale obviously Why expend energy in lifting instead of rolling
We have flying cars Theybare called airplanes
There will be flying taxis at the Paris olympics this summer winkingface
But not in Zambia We are still a long way to achieve this milestone
It would be worldwide
This is not true humans will simply be reallocated to other jobs the same argument was done during the industrial age Today we already have automation in farming enough to feed everyone So why do we still work  
"I find it it funny how someone can compare the Industrial era with AI 
You most likely do not understand what’s AI Automation is one thing
Not needing truck drivers and doctors is another"
momomama2510 Actually I work with AI and understand it better than the common Joe AI will give society a boost in productivity just like the internet or like electricity did Not more not less about the same level   
"TheEmperor000 I use AI for work too and I know it will 100 replace millions of jobs and not give any alternative The industrial age gave people alternatives 
The necessity to have a human watching over AI is just temporary and far less humans will be needed for that role in every industry"
"Yeah sure AI can also cook and clean and raise kids and take out the trash

Please MrMusk I feel like youre trying to drive up share prices of some AI startup you invested in"

"if our lives will still have their meaning 
Im a young man 25 here And I really have been listening to what people are talking about life 
 And if someone attaches their lifes meaning to 95 job its either
 A politician  rich guy  that does want to keep the old ways going not sure why maybe its the right thing to do or he is afraid of loosing meaning of his high status if everyone would have more 
 its a person who can even struggle in life financially on wagslavery  but because he doesnt get the good life he wont agree to make any step towards better future for people And his favorite quote is  Shouldve work harder you lazy ass 
 Neutral class guy  Some of these people can be truly passionate about life and understand general struggles but still lots of them are feeling comfortable enough to think that if he made it it has to be our fault that we dont have a good life x whatever good life means in his silly head

There is hope there is also insanely big amount of knowledge and meaning yet to be discovered in life  Our society is really but really the opposite of what it truly means to be alive 
But we have to start asking right questions What will we do what makes us happy how do each and every person would like to continue their personal growth in society without jobs 

I find myself just a little lucky because even I am very poor wageslave person I feel and know truly what my path to happiness is I know what I would love to focus on what to do where to began  its something I think everyone can learn but it starts outside of the weird joblife cycle we created so far 

Have a nice and wonderful life my beings Lets hope we will get the future right as we are smart enough to do it we just need to want it as ALL 



P S 
For clever folks that would want to disagree on my view and why Im 25 in wage class  I have ADHD and slight AS  and in this society we live in there is no hope for people like me most of the time    IF we even get diagnosed no pills no therapy can make your life fixed or the demage weve taken during our lifes Once it get too far we are left behind on our own

"One possible solution is a basic income system This concept involves giving everyone a regular unconditional sum of money regardless of employment status A basic income could provide financial security and ensure that people have the means to purchase essential goods and services This model has been tested in various places and has shown promise in reducing poverty and boosting local economies


Another approach is profitsharing models In this system companies share a portion of their profits with employees or even customers This method aligns the interests of the business with those of its stakeholders creating a sense of shared success Profitsharing can help distribute wealth more evenly and ensure that as companies grow so do the financial benefits for the broader community"

This Elon Musk is mad and hes doing everything for money thus destroying mankind
Thats my revelation and warning to those concern"
Well  the fools should also know that if non of us will have a job phrase  has a message go humanity  then he should also know that jobless and hungry people will become angry and aggressive  and a riot of smashes those dumb puppets would create the end of their existence

Andrew yang idea of every citizen owning 20 robots and paid by their productivity
You can bet noone Is going to pay you anything They will keep saying You need a job
How about an AI Dividend for all Since everyones data goes into training AI which then out competes them for traditional jobs we need to find a way to distribute the wealth gains from these technologies which everyones data helped create back to everyone Musk called it a UHI or Unconditional High Income Kinda like a UBI but why keep it basic in a future of continuously improving AI
NikoKun yang had ideas on this
Just 10000 AI models can take away more than 10 lakh jobs with future advancements in different areas
Elon musk has opinion on everythingjust like kimjongun
And his opinions is either often incorrect or hes stating the obvious or he might state what someone else has said as though it were is own insight Musk is a rat
Many tech moguls who have contributed to the development of internet and technology are realising the danger and threat that unbridled development of AI can bring on education employment artistic expression and society as a whole They are voicing their concerns Deepfakes can cause personal injury pose a threat to institutions and compound problems for national security It can further polarise the atmosphere Privacycyber threat and algorithm bias will make the online space more unsafe Gold rush in silicon valley are ignoring these concerns and anxieties The government and the industry need to intervene as they have the technical and monetary resources to get away with almost everything
That implies we wont need our current monetary system that ties every goods and services in the world to one single imposed scheme Thats exactly the star trek utopia No scarcity no modern Adam Smith economic system But anyone with a brain senses this is pretty much in the realm of possibility but not reality Meaning Musk is just trolling around as always
most of his predictions were wrong not sure why people take this man seriously
"Musk  pretends to care
He has an ulterior motive for  his utterances
He supports China  the  1 enemy of the world because he feels its  in his interest to do so
He like the Chinese do whatever is necessary to  advance their  interests 
Neither  should be trusted
Use them  in the same way they are using others"
"Elon Musk needs to register as a foreign agent FARA for the work he performed at the behest of the Chinese China government
 He helped China to export forced labor made in China  electric cars to other countries
 He complained all the time but always praised the Chinese regime
 He advocated for AI slowdown so that China could catch up
 He blocked his Starshield satelite  service in Taiwan
 He repeated Chinese lies of the century about independent Taiwan country as a province of China"
Ok Indian
These humans who didn’t bring themselves here telling you what’s going to happen Then good then we won’t need monies we will live for free and there won’t have a need for monies
Elon Musk has no idea what is comingrollingonthefloorlaughing
Hes in the process of making these robots and AI that are going to replace humans what do you mean he has no idea
isaacanthony Exactly do you think AI requires human beings anymore They will be able to self replicate faster than humans and this is only the begining
Didnt he knows this before 
Elon must your AI cannot buid buildings or run cab its too long to go  just dont make iwords gane fooling public
More time for us to further ourselves as human beings
Id hope so
Humans stopped being humans when the industrial revolution came
Only a rich person says Jobs will be optional
You have no reasoning capabilities
Dude he provides jobs to so many people so he decides what to do with people what are you on
mohann2289 he is expected to be a farmer idk what else he wants what do you expect when Ai takes over Whats ur solution To compete against robots Go right ahead

Ron there will be jobs for humans just not paying as well as their old jobs and talk about unemployment Everyone will need to be on the government Dole Social Security will need to start earlier                   But someone will come along and hire all the lowly humans Youll have a paycheck like I said just not as much as you would expect
No countries including the USA will not follow the speed of job demolition
No Ai wouldnt replace your job because itll break the cycle of economy
hundredpointshundredpoints
Electrical is still hungry So much work Now I got land and I’m working toward personal agriculture
Nobody asked for AI AI is designed to eliminate jobs Thats why it exists Joe Sixpack doesnt give AF about more tech to learn Nobody cares Only Silicon Valley and corporate execs care about AI
Deep learning engineers laughing in the back
The rich will use robots to take the poor out Its the only path i see happening
They want WW3 to happen asap it seems
What about cybersecurity 
Quite a few jobs will be replaced by AI The obvious ones are copyrighters programmers photographers writers and musicians But the really big effect will come from robotics As robotics and AI converge more menial and repetitive tasks that provided jobs in the middleclass or lowerclass will be lost This includes drivers fast food workers distribution center jobs all delivery service home healthcare workers garbage collection most factory jobs most YouTube channels Those are just the ones that are top of mind There will be many others too
If your in IT your screwed facewithtearsofjoy
You are becoming better at talking about things you dont even know how they work Especially with too many words and with no gap

"AI  The newer sexier name for the same old COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY and ROBOTICS from 35 years ago 

REAL AI is not here yet and it is questionable as to whether it is even possible"
"Biggest losers will be computer programmerscoders
It takes weeksmonths to properly code something
And weeksmonths of testing to fix all the glitcheserrors
AI can code it nearly errorfree within minutes
So why would a company spend millions on teams of coders
And why Asians will be most affected by AI"
So it sounds like if you don’t have an advanced degree and technology you’re pretty much screwed
Want they did not think about is all the unemployed people will not be able to afford the goods and services produced by AI Nobody thought about that so AI completely destroyed the economy

You can’t automate sales facewithtearsofjoy
The rich will prosper The poor will live in tents
What jobs  Who is going to buy what AI is selling
Progress is inevitable As AI evolves we must adapt or risk obsolescence Complaints won’t halt innovation only personal growth
Lets be honest Nobody wants to work in jobs that are harmful to health Me neither Besides I dont want to work 8 hours a day but a maximum of 4 or 3 a day and receive a really decent salary not a scrap I want to have money for shopping fees and have a lot of time for myself I also dont want to work somewhere far from home because it counts as a waste of time No one will give me back the time Even money wont do it Seriously Do you want to work I dont I just need food health care and a house  comfort I dont need you
I hope they take all the jobs and leave humans to progress humanity Break us from Money and the Government Cog Free labor baby We are so f

AI are going to replace humans
redheart this channel Keep up the good info So many people fall outta the know Believe it or not AI is still going to be a shock for a lot of peoplefacewithtearsofjoy
Vlad you complain so much No one cares about AI TAKING JOBS Its going happen no matter what you do I SAY LET AI TAKE OVER THE WORLD hopefully the asteroid comes quick
Let ai take over EVERYTHING That way humanity can focus on the important things in life like family and spirit
Be a monk and no worry AI will replace you
Industrial Manufacturing and Production isn’t going anywheres  These robot Arms there constantly braking down and the maintenance mechanics constantly have to fix them  And the Production people are always troubleshooting them and operating these robots   Look at These Car Manufacturers theres Robots there literally Doing Everything constructing these Cars putting them together And the Production people and the Maintenance Mechanics are Operating these Machines Troubleshooting them fixing them  There’s been Robots in the Car Manufacturing industry for Many Years and there’s still production workers at these Car Plants Companies are always going to need people Blue collar Jobs aren’t going anywheres  social Media just wants to Scare you and its nonsense lol Truckers  are not going anywheres  either robots can’t drive a  18 wheeler articulatedlorry truck headshakinghorizontallyrollingonthefloorlaughing there’s more to it then just driving it  Putting brokenchain Chains on the Tires wheel  for Snow and Ice on the Roads Tarping  Strapping  Lashing  Unloading the Truck lol rollingonthefloorlaughing depending on who you work for or course But yea robots there not  going to take are jobs  Maybe in the Fast Food industry and Customer Service Sht like that These Robots will be More like as a Tool to help us But there not going to take over the World  globeshowingAmericas lol  lmao rollingonthefloorlaughing everyone you guys watch to many movies  The Fck this isn’t   IRobot lol rollingonthefloorlaughing
After seeing that robot working on macdonalds No wonder why artist and graphic designers are worried about AI taking their jobs
This was the plan all along
Just ban AI simple let AI only be used for a tool for information Nothing else Its not that hard simple
AI is already good enough to take millions of jobs away when physical robots start rolling out and AI gets more advanced I don’t see anyone keeping their jobs AI will simply be able to do everything better I have a prediction though that society as a whole is gonna have to restructure with a world where most ppl don’t have jobs something is gonna have to change or there will be riots
All that artwork and the images that AI uses  to produce their collages are stolen from Instagram and and all other social media sites where you post your work  Instagram wont even let you opt out of letting AI steal your work anymore  Every creator is fleeing
How are you saying HR managers are not going to be affected If there is no human working what’s the need of Human resource management Insane logic facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy
"rollingonthefloorlaughing Totally In fact the same logic applies to a lot of safety jobs mentioned in the list
Teachers for example in a world when careers are not relevant at all why people would spend money hours and years studying something specific that will get you anything in return"
There is no job that will be safe from agi period
Ai is not running anything  it doesnt even Do my spell check accurately There are three ways to use the word two        To   Two Too AI cant determine which one to pick for the right termIve found many things just in that simularity AIAint running nothing Everything with computers is always pre program Computers can not learn their program to learn what you teach them and thats where it ends computers do not have a conscious mind human beings are the only ones  With a conscious mind on the planet Humans arent smart enough to figure things out as it isI dont expect use to understand this All AI  computers only can do what humans pre Program they cant think outside the box They dont have a conscious mind and some of you Humans dont seem to use yours Good luck on the next 2 clownsThats gonna be a president
I cant wait for them to take most jobs away so we can have time to be free for a while before they enslave us allgrinningfacewithsweat jk but I really do think this stuff can be used for good
Sounds like something took out of a scifi book but ultimately this is going to happen Imagine the riots strikes and chaos in the streets when people start struggling governments will have to implement Order and a lot of crazy things will happen with people with no job
"What I get from AI stuff is it will be easier and possibly cheaper for more people to be a boss and harder to be an employee let alone a low level employee For example if you are an artist maybe you should start focusing less on drawing yourself but more on art direction with AI tools and finding ways to get your indie final product out in the consumer market With these tools a person could potentially become a one manwoman small company Embrase the tools you get and try to think more as a higher level enterpreneur

With tools like ChatGPT is also easier to get crucial knowhow about a particular project you are not familiar with Before you would google for eons read arbitrary forums to get opinions an so on"
Mine hell no I create them
Well luckily Im a driver You cant replace me But all I hear is you have to use the new tools to make sure youre needed Ill just use my GED skills to be an AI programmer
This is the reason the are messing around with SSA  They have used it and now they are abusing it  They have no right to do what they are doing in all of this  They squander the countries money and then they think they can make it on their own  Stupid and empty I would not want to be them
If people dont want to use those companies for this they wont have a company very long  I have known this kind of mentality would use AI  I also know these companies depend on a wage earner using their services  If a wage earner quits using their services the end result is ruin  I dont know how people that are smart enough to start up and expand their company did not come to this conclusion
Fewer workers means lower tax revenues SSA goes cash flow negative sooner USA annual budget deficit gets larger faster national debt explodes inflation higher
They wont be working on roads
So when the jobs are gone then what LOL they talk about just giving people money That is not a long term option Perhaps the greek city leaders  of old had the better idea when presented with a machine that could do the job of several men The elders said destroy it because the men it replaced would not have jobs
"I’m very interested in Ai I see it as huge opportunity currently learning python

Growing job demand in automating every job out of existence lol
Always think Im gonna come back to the video later Then I watch the intro and Im hooked I have to watch it now
Imagine If you go to Mc donald and ask robot for a burger they can t work as fast as humans
General income will eventually be standard and then money will be phased out in a fully automated world
This is the result of what you get for sending Johnny to college to get an EDUCATION  We now have a society that is totally incapable of thinking independently or doing any type of MANUAL labor Ironically the AI robot will probably replace your IDIOT college professor
Will AI be the new consumers
Genuinely curious— How is it that data specialists are not the first to be replaced— they can already almost do the job of an average data analyst
So has anybody thought about how anyone is going to be able to afford to buy things from AI when nobody has a job Will the AI be making things for other AI or… Has nobody thought about this
Strikes riots chaos in the streets All this is going to happen when millions of unemployed people realize the reality and by them governments will enforce law and a lot of dystopia things will occur Yeah sounds like a conspiracy or something took out of scifi book but thats the ultimate outcome if people dont ask the question youre proposing
As a cybersecurity analyst I do not consider AI a  threat to my job but rather an augmentation to increase my capability at doing my task By automating repetitive tasks such as reoccurring security incidents that otherwise  would overwhelm security  analyst professionals
My only hope I have all the top five on the skill chart
We’re screwed definitely screwed
What about consultants
Consultants are like interprets and translators you can actually ask the AI and within seconds you will receive the answer and assistance you need Dont get me wrong Im not laughing at it or undervaluing these jobs quite the contrary I know in person the time it takes to be knowledgeable in these fields but reality is that these kind of jobs are the first ones in line to be taken out
"Did not know you could put this much into such a short video I bet his script was written by GPT2 D The racial bias in his statistics is a common problem
The person is walking on space shows a person walking through a desert like area on a planet surface dude that is not space looks more like slat lakes in the desert than space you need editors to put everything together you need consistent look and people for filmography with a wide selection of facial expressions and AI is just not there yet yeah you can create cool stuff I crate a 1500 pictures a day scale some up and reuse them but the consistency is just not where it should be

ChatGPT passed the Bar Exam I bet Lawyers will feel a hit for low level paperwork I dont need to pay 1000 to a lawyer when ChatGPT can write the document I need I see this more happening than txt2blockbuster video AI D Same with writers you know that you can use ChatGPT for system analysis right now for the average stuff it is good enough

How is customer service on the rise and will at the same time be replaced by AI D

Analytic thinking is problem solving so it is actually on second spot

Yeah ai can gladly take over the jobs at fast food spots like Mcdonalds The little asshole employees act like they dont wanna be there anyways
Said nothing
Will panel beating job be around if there is alot of EV cars are in the market or autonomous vehicles I want to get in this job I live in Australia
Like the person representing an automobile manufacturing plant said the union rep soon robots would replace all the workers They dont get tired they dont take vacations or call off or go on strike etc The union rep asked But do they buy cars

when do u think ai will start to take over at a fast rate also robots humanoids
"​kyleday5026I mean they are doing AI announcements in daily basis and offering betas of crazy things which makes me wonder If this is the commercial stuff what kind of technology they have in secret so the Dystopia is not far away in the future
Strikes riots and chaos are going to take place as soon as the people get unemployed and this is looming over the horizon maybe 2 years top
At that point governments will enforce law and people will be arrested and rule of the jungle will be implemented"
They can have mine my bodys ruined
Yes The front counter operator is now an app OR AI voice assistant to the crew
Tbh no AI is taking humans job you talk like a 9 year old Today People be like wow AI revolutionary computer  blah blahhbut AI and automation was made for boring work Humans  are creativethe peer pressure to to makes us slaves is annoying and ugly There are other stuff then just running after a job This is fucked mfs are telling us only about AI Jobs This is not development this is straight slavery I aint falling this shit
MR BIG NOSE CARES AS MUCH AS NOBODY ELSE
when you say AI you have to be clear Ai is a form or intelligents what are taking are jobs are robots use as a tool to do a job they know only one thing whereas AI can act human and can be used to fool people
The old robots will take your job who will be the consumer base when jobs are even fewer

You don’t know what you’re talking about You must be new around here
Itll be about 50 years before it happens Ive read though
Ohhh no no no Its happening right now Take me for an example Went to higher education to become a graphic designer and theres no jobs available Theyre firing workers and replacing them with the ex employees work turned into ai
"There are already people replaced by Ai
In few years even physical jobs will be replaced by ai"
What we really need to be talking about and asking is at what point do things get so good that we actually start actually helping people instead of perpetuating this “you need to have a job to justify your existence and live” system Feels like everything has gotten better in the last 100 years but the benefits of that is reserved for fewer and fewer each year We need to grow up as a species

AI Is going to Destroy The Working Class
That is what the elite want
This is bidens america Losing millions of jobs instead of giving them Also idc about politics and know it has nothing to do with Biden but it’s annoying to hear it huh
"Okay
No one is going to purchase the products or services created by AI
All they are actually doing is destroying the worth of everything and no amount of legislation and laws are going to unfuk this and force peopel to start buying things 

The technology to render nearly everything they are creating with that AI or we woudl purchase from brick and mortar stores is easily found and made locally now

Teachers are going to be replaced Psychiatrist already getting replaced
How
"Teachers are useless 
I never could learn from teacher
I have better time learning by my self"
"​​yunusgokcen174Teachers like any other safe jobs mentioned in this list are going to be irrelevant as well

Human resources for example
What purpose would have a HR manager if real people is not working or hired

Teachers In a world where any career is irrelevant because AI can do that skill in seconds dont romantize the importance of knowledge soul and art in any project because companies and masses dont give a dime about that why people would spend money hours and years studying something specific that will get you anything in return"
no robots with artificial intelligence will better assist in industries where heavy loads will have to be carried so their interests are then they can also take over if the employee takes leave smilingfacewithsmilingeyesthumbsup
non justement les robots avec intelligence artificielle vont mieux assister dans les industries où il faudra porter des charges lourdes donc ses intéressent est puis sa peu prendre aussi le relais si le employé prend des congé smilingfacewithsmilingeyesthumbsup
Thats good thumbsupthumbsupthumbsup because many will go for one field and make great achievements there
Look at the McDonalds ice cream machines Im not worried we cant keep them working How is a hole restaurant gonna work
Im gonna marry a warehouse robot and be a stay at home husband 
I’m sorry I know this is serious but at 115 when he repeats that AI will impact Asians the most while seriously looking at the camera followed by stock footage of an Asian typing into a laptop is sending me lmfaoo
Policemen militaries lecturers teachers nurses doctors tax collectors and many more will not be replaced
Are you kidding Do you think there will be human soldiers when can simply send a basic robot into the battlefield That will be one of the first use cases of robots
"Teachers seriously Why people would spend money hours and years studying something specific that will get you anything in return
Designers writers musicians counters interpreters etc are being replaced so why teachers are needed for And even though I love knowledge and information and maybe you too we belong to a minimum percent of people who would learn out of love but masses in general only study to get a job So what would be the point of teachers in thats scenario
You can apply the same concept to any profession out there"
Also to everyone that is upset youre not wrong in feeling so youve done everything right and got screwed nothing youve done couldve changed that I understand this guys tough love i come from a family of military members its a “eat shit and get back up” mentality Its important to be strong minded and be resilient It is also important to know that you are human and you should be upset if you feel you are wronged dont be a robot Everything will be okay if you want it to but it wont if you give up now  This is just a reality check just dont go numb because in doing that you still lose Good luck and stay safe

Im totally agree with you
Lol whats gonna happen when the power goes out
You need one skill above all and that is the skill for SURVIVAL
It wasnt that long ago the tech sector was telling blue collar workers learn to code boy did that backfire
I love ai
A lot of people actually suck at their job and being held on by their company is simply a form of welfare that all the other employees that actually do their job must pay for
Why tf wont lawyers and judges be affected The law is WRITTEN literally every single law has a registered number Why not
top ten skills goes to use buzz words lmao
If people want to be with people Then how is the salesperson industry going to fall out I feel as though that’s one of the most vital jobs that people want to actually buy from someone else

Same thing were said about the computers 50 years ago Guess what  it did not happen If they really will create a humanoid robot with an AI mind inside of it so it can serve me a french fries at McDonald instead use it to conquere other planets I will literally lose my faith in humanity
As soon as they raise wages AI is implemented
I honestly dont see this going any other way than the super wealthy of today getting richer and the wealth gap and other issues of today being made worse than we can imagine
I dont see why humans and robots cant work together honestly
It will never work because as ceo if I have choice between human who want health insurance and money and rest days or I can take ai and maybe pay a cheap monthly subscription and I win 
I respect your opinion but it is best for everyone if we cooperate
Then close all the Schools and Universities pay us a derivative from those bots and move us down the road  I wonder what they will do about the Military
Yall not looking at the bigger picture AI will take away all thr jobs Then the government will cut everybody a little check once a month Then they will cancel out all voting because they give us a little check once a month then will will set up a 20 miles radius from your apartment you can go by Then you will not be able to travel because you have to ask them for permission first all the time which will get turn down 90 percent of the time You cant own land or houses basically everybody is a slave accept rich people they can do what they want when they want See what LOBBYISTS do for you in America
We just need to stay in a leaning mode
I’m willing to adapt
Every secure job that was listed will be replaced as well Just a bit later And we will realize more and more with every GPT and Tech Update Especially everything related to AI and Data AI will do it better soon

"But what these companies would do with cost cutting when people wont have money to buy their cheap products
People will default on loans and since income is low people will not invest Hence the economy will collapse"
AI beat up my cat
Swell robotics and Ai jobloss is the only things I worry about anymore Anyone else feel the same
The promis of capitalism is you work a job you live a prosperous life  There is nothing wrong with ai it is just not compatible with capitalism not so long as capitalism requires everyone who wants to live a prosperous life to work a job

hah ok  AI will replace millions of people but then those people will not have income so they wont buy food and other goods then who is going to use the products of AI labour Replacement of people with AI is the worst idea because the economy will just go in deeper and deeper recession
Those who own the machines and AI will use the labour obviously
Or you can just retire early if you’re worried about AI

Here come the Cylons
As a teacher I could list a thousand reasons why our jobs cant be done by AI if you understand teaching is about way more than just content delivery video
"According to a report by the World Economic Forum  AI will create around 97 million new roles

AI is similar to electricity in our daily life We have to live with it 

Give us Positive news and keep video titles in a positive motto"
Those jobs are Green Jobs they will not be for you
They are also part of the Care Home economy This is what will actually happen instead of UBI your given 15 dollars to spend each week while you OFF yourself I recommend nursing as a career option all though it will get automated as well Imagine taking care of the displaced workers as opposed to being a displaced worker Take MTF hormones bypass the DEI HR lady and become the caretaker

Teachers will remain as lets face it you need them out of your hair for a few hours at least You cant work from home with kids screaming in the background and look professional Most parents are absolutely not equipped to teach their offspring basic skills teachers do more than teach acedemic skills They teach social skills self control and life skills So many kids arrive to school lacking any of these at all Its the first line of defense against in home abuse often the only decent meal a child gets all day Yes there are cool technology programs to teach academic concepts and teachers are being trained to implement these into the classroom right now Your kids are increasingly integrating tech into class either by online books learning software and hardware Teachers will remain Maybe they will have real chat bots that are not dumb currently they are using folks in call centers overseas as chat bots are hyped beyond their capabilities lol more often than you realize you are actually dealing with someone real Maybe we get intelligent robotics that can actually function outside of a very narrow set of parameters that can adapt to the variety of tasks a human worker is capable of Right now they have models that somewhat work in labs under strict controlled scenarios Just like self driving vehicles the transition to real world might take way longer than anticipated All these lists are based off marketing hype and not proven tech Thing is whats hard for humans is easy to automate but whats easy and intuitive to us is extremely hard tor robots We have been promised rainbows and unicorns but so far only have clouds and hoof beats Law field is currently being hit real hard as well as accounting right now Creative industries as well but the skilled labor groups supposedly to be hit hardest well they are the best pisitioned currently Vecome an electrician or plumber Welding however is increasing in automation quickly Granted warehouse and factory floors are automating more and more Oh and medical field Automation is better at reading scans than us and robotic surgeons exist but public fear has that one held down so I wouldnt pronounce surgeons safe Lab tech either The computers get rolled in the room take your vitals set flowrates and monitor you all tasks once done by nursing staff Yeah right now someone wheels it in but its mostly to keep the patient from freaking outrollingonthefloorlaughing Unless we demand human interface thats soon gone So many kids I know prefer to not actually have a human My youngest adult child absolutely will choose self checkout if hes forced to go to a store but honestly he orders in for almost every single thing He does not want to interact with a cashier My oldest just told me Columbus has a restaurant where food is brought to the table by a robot He said he actually prefers it to a waitstaff So yeah it all depends on if they can crack real world Turns out humans are unpredictable little rascals that you just dont know how they will react and think Logic doesnt describe how most of us navigate this worldrollingonthefloorlaughing The next several years are going to be critical Either we fight to keep human capital in the workforce are jobs go away They have UBI figured out Pist labor economics is a big thing right now Maybe do a collaboration with Ben Shapiro not that one the other Ben Shapiro Hes got a good youtube channel on pist labor economics AI and its pitential and such Its fairly optimistic in its outlook abd food for thought
"Yes it will iv seen it first hand AI is the new version of automating the conveyor belt jobs Told it will help them do their job not take them Now the conveyor belt has a 14 of the staff working

So effectively everyone out of work who will buy these companies products if no income coming in

After all Theodore Kaczynski 1995 and his manifesto Industrial Society and Its Future was right in somethingThey have greatly increased the lifeexpectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries but they have destabilized society have made life unfulfilling have subjected human beings to indignities have led to widespread psychological suffering in the Third World to physical suffering as well and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world The continued development of technology will worsen the situation It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries Are we exaggerating  or are we are allowing our destruction
This will be great for mankind in the long run People will have to be better and try to learn something useful If you think this is bad then you should go to Japan and see how the people live and act We can take lessons from them

If that’s the case we wouldn’t need people to help us at the self checkout I’m pretty sure it’s going to take time and alot of companies are not going to do well People don’t want to deal with automated anything especially a robot that has no emotional understanding Anything could happen but there’s always going to be a job to have to fix themwinkingface

Why not make ai do the farming we could be a self sufficient Americans but they will use it to bird feed us thats going to be a big difference also humanity is over then
I just wanted asked whole people who promote this AI Digital biometric face recognition locks have been around for quite some time yet were still relying on traditional keys and locks Similarly theres a plethora of cuttingedge machines designed to slice and dice fruits and vegetables efficiently but many of us still resort to using regular knives Technological adoption doesnt happen overnight it often takes decades Just like how trends come and go the panic around AI will eventually fade away much like the concerns around the coronavirus pandemic AI is just tool It not going to replace us that much easily man They just give the out put based on the things we have fed man
Sir about the construction field did its effect if AI comes
Make sure have type job they cant do
Ai doesnt support capitalism They do no shopping So
We may need a whole army of Unabombers the AI threat is more dangerous than the globalist threat Though they overlap Technology in general is making humanity meaningless I used to be a libertarian and very proscience and proprogress And I still am in most cases but Ive adopted very radical views on suspending technological advancement until our culture and self discipline can be mastered We need to master our natural selves our mind body and soul before we play God with technology
We must become more godlike in order to act like God Being a bunch of fat dumb lazy monkeys with access to nukes and AI aint working
Anyone who thinks AI will replace accountants has no friggin clue what an accountant actually does

This guy says leverage Reality is 70 of what employs ppl has no leverage So you mean 70 gone find jobs im the 30 facewithtearsofjoy no It says one thing They will nuke the population Robots arent meant to help They are meant to eliminate human input they just lie and say it meant to “make the world better” Question is what world are they “making better”

When will the public express not to give a F about businesses using AI  Robot service can never replace human service People will realize we love to be active
People need to stop being so shortsighted and understand AI needs to take everyones jobs Human work human get paid usually Assuming human greed wont play a role in a perfect world if AI takes everyones jobs what we call money would be useless in the grand scheme of things Whether you like it or not money is the route of ALL problems and thats just reality it would be great if AI eventually did all the work Money would no longer be a thing and humanity could truly thrive for the first time and stop letting this thing we made up called money hinder our progression as a species The problem is how long it would take for AI to eventually take everyones jobs and how theyd implement such a thing over time Clearly people arent going to like it initially until it benefits them personally Greed greed greed and more greed
These companies better remember if people get cut from jobs they got know money to spend  You spent a lot of money on junk to replace them  profits go to hell

As someone who works in Ai heavily I can say that Ai will replace easily half or more of all jobs within 10 or 15 years especially as Ai robots improve rapidlyits not just white collar jobs it will be lots of blue collar too Anyone who thinks that an AGI highlyintelligent machine cant replace HR or attorneys etc is insanely wrong Humans will still have work but it will be very different after we have AGI Humans would likely need to serve Ai in various ways which I do not like Elon Musk is right when he says that we will need a universal incomeand as a capitalist I do hate that The fix is to make laws now that ensure that humans can keep working even when Ai is faster and smarter I hope that some people read this and trust what this random guy on the internet says its trueI dont like it but its true Just because I work in this field now doesnt mean I can fix things on my own

1 thing i didnt see is the rise in technical mechanical and trade jobs Which will be needed to maintain the AI robotics and infrastructure that AI will be using

Who did you tell that schools and universities will exist in the future I mean they will but I doubt that the buildings and class rooms would be needed for this because the coronavirus pandemic has proven that students can easily study material while sitting at home and yes the AI can also check testsexams and give grades
Then only a person qualified to be a babysitter is required to watch child with robot  Or a robot that is more engaging than a teacher
Maybe there wont be kids to like after  anymore
Home schooling sweetheart
The only reason it is safe is that people wont be accepting voluntarily robot teachers into their schools even if they are better but to be honest as we see society develop it will be accepted in some nations at some point so no screen with cameras can do same and more mainly because teachers are already limited on disciplination anyway so they wont be far apart from what they can do

AI feeds on internet It is so stupid that the internet has been here only for 20 years and humanity has put their entire learning in the net so much that an almost alien brain that now decipher the knowledge more than the human brain The knowledge systems that are to be revered as sacred have been sold by the capitalists to an unknown intelligence  As it is the present generation seems to be so dependent on machines that native human learning techniques such as memory intuition and imagination seem to be fading off No wonder the ancient civilisations kept their wisdom under wraps

This replaces the horse  the tractor the driver the loaders the accountant the shopkeeper and soon the repairmen 

That’s okay you think the worker will just go into town and find a new job When he is there he notices that machines are making burgers the receptionist at the hotel is artificial the bank teller is a screen the taxis drives themselves 

This is a different beast We are outsourcing the only thing that makes most of us valueable in modern society intelligence"
While their has always been progress and advancement that have replaced some humans  AI is a whole new ball game  It will have the capacity in very short order to replace every sit down desk job in the world  every single one  Not a problem I will get a trade job nope  As the majority of the workforce will not be working they will not be able to buy what they need you as a tradesman to build or repair for them So tradie  your gone too  It is time to face facts and stop sugar coating it  AI will cause economies to collapse in on themselves  Were stuffed
No
Watching the video but I do have to say this people seem to mistake AI with fullon walking Androids AI is not going to replace The guy doing manual labor or the guy flipping burgers its going to replace the guy managing the guy flipping burgers and doing manual labor Its basically its the semirich middle class yuppies that will be out of a job not people working retail or food service or manual labor we are very far away from full on walking talking robots that can do jobs like that those robots would be called Androids and by that time T1000 is coming for you The only one I dont agree with is a warehouse workers if youve seen on a warehouse operated by robots trying to pull orders you realize real quick that that just doesnt work its nowhere near as efficient as human beings

"Here a few things that should be considered when talking about this topic I know that you want this video to be positive inspirering and motivating but you miss out many important things regarding this topic So first regarding the home office topic It is mentioned pretty often by media and big companies like google and meta use it as excuse to fire people but of course thats not the real reason I can tell you from my own company and many other companies I work with that we have over 90 of people in home office right now from 50 to 100 of the time With that we changed our  offices to way smaller ones and save millions of  annually So if you say that people should not work in home office that would actually increase the costs many fold
The other important point is that AI and robotics are not  disruptive technologies like we had before where some jobs are replaced while at the same time many other new jobs are created New jobs will be created that will replace many other jobs For example we will have accountant AI manager who will replace all accountant jobs of a company But there will also be the jobs that will be replaced 100 because people without any expertice can use the AI to solve problems and complete this jobs
Without going into too much details here what would be the outcome if we dont talk about it and dont create a new form of income At this point I dont know if the economy wouls actually survive that
With the reduction of jobs the wealth will be spread to fewer people lets say 50 of the poeple will have jobs in 10 to 15 years That also means that the wealth will spread to fewer companies 50 of people without jobs will become something like third rate humans lesser humans We will get a split sociaty That usually leads to wars and civil wars 
We have to talk about this problems and find a solution for this"

AI CANNOT take over Yes It can crash everything but then what It has no physical presence not can it Build itself Nor can it repair itself Power has to be maintained by humans so it would lose the power plants very quick Ai even if it became self aware would have to scheme and plan and wait for the technology to be able to built and maintain itself Otherwise its just AI in the Digital realm Which is still no joke But again if it lost power without people whats the point Internet would go down Servers would go down

This is such nonsense Setting aside the fact that AI isnt even real the way these reports are put together is asinine They just assume that if an element of your job can be automated your entire job can be automated Thats fucking stupid Automate all retail Im sure an employee free store wont have any problems with theft Automate away accountants Youd literally need to rewrite laws to do that As an aside BetDavids assertion that teachers can be automated away cause we have screens is a perfect example of how idiotic these predictions are As if theres no value from having a person involved We literally tried the online learning thing during the pandemic it led to kids being multiple years behind in their education This is true galaxy brain thinking that is completely divorced from the reality of how business and jobs work The most I would be willing to bet is that perhaps some small percentage of jobs can be eliminated tho primarily thru increased efficiency but that most jobs will simply change as some functions of the role automate The automation will free workers up to focus on other tasks Im assuming this because this is literally what always happens Also AI isnt real so theres not a snowballs chance in hell it can actually do the full job of a customer service rep It can handle basic tasks but as soon as you need any advanced work like dealing with billing or technical issues youll have to be sent to a human
People are already lonely and the last thing people need is to talk to a lifeless system for a product

AI is suicide And we dont know it
Nobody even asked for AI Its being pushed on us People need to have value in their lives which includes work
i dont have a job
I bet associates degrees will be absolute and even alot bachelors jobs will be comprised
Based on data between this year and that year this jobs will be replaced by AI What data facewithtearsofjoy I would much more prefer to see that data and who collected it and how then random ppl creating videos like this without any real proof just guess work The data was probably collected only from USA and by some random blog website or news outlet which obviously cant be trusted as proven facts

I think the problem of a lot of classic liberals tech entusiats is tehy sill dont realized that if AI replace the amount of the job that everyone are saying as faster as saying most of human wont have TIME to learning someting new Think about a father who works 6 days 8 hours and have family kids So suddenly lost his job but most of the jobs outside was replaced How this person will  learning something very outside of his career in a fast way 

These upper class people are just out of the reality"

cognitive decline has already started it started when it was easier for young people to get info off of one of the millions of websites available via the internet rather than exercise your critical thinking by doing  research the hard way ie  books periodicals and pounding the pavement  You can see that cognitive decline can be mapped proportionately to each successive generation that has more tools via AI the internet than the previous one the eventual progression of this trend would be that NO independent thought would be required  Try asking college students the simplest elementary school questions that were taught to children in the 1960s and see what answers you get then map the QA by generation and see if I am not correct
AI makes decisions  So if you have a job where you are a decision maker youre out  It will do a better job than you will do  Teachers will be replaced
Long term  Maybe 100 maybe 200 years we may not just evolve beyond Capitalism we may actually evolve beyond a monetary system An economy of abundance war is obsolete money has become obsolete  We’ll have to start with a 30hr workweek to spread the work around then 25 then 20 maybe we stop at 15hr workweeks to keep the boredom at bay  People could have a lot more free time to try and improve themselves improve their community  Kind of like Star Trek

No AI is going to replace your job If AI started doing everything which is technically not possible but hypothetically if AI started doing everything people will start their agriculture work again and i think that is going to be the best job for human being at least it will reduce lots of pollution  and we can live with our family like our ancestors used to live their life
Asking as a fellow veteran — advice on how to transition from having software “job” to being paid as an agency I’m learning every AI available in my current day job in an ai integration specialist   I am getting dual citizenship in Mexico through my mom’s birth country — yet I’m still only finding “jobs” and not keeping up with Liam Ottley  I’m years in python automation as a specialty … so what would you do to switch the course of my outcome

Then what’s the point of paying bills if the robots are doing the job 
AI will also enable an average person to run something like an excavation business completely automated with no other employees  Tesla will be a taxi service that generates income passively  We will be better off actually
It will replace 99 of the jobs and humans as at least free time to focus other more interesting stuffs in the life instead of working all day by day Most of things will become free and easier available Like home food electricity etc

Don’t start crying now nobody wanted to work and thought they gonna be the next online social media super hero when corporations don’t have the bodies to fill the positions and politics forcing them to hire based on skin color instead of experience this only motivated them to spend even more money to figure out a way to just fire everyone and hire something that can’t complain or sue and demand to be called him his hers he ha who what wee wee what idk what ever else this is the result me personally I just build kiosk after kiosk to get the job done and no problems
The reason teachers are safe is because having a human to interact with is valued by many people I agree l they could be replaced but convincing American families that they should trust an AI to teach their kids is going to be a long battle Not to mention teacher unions and schools boards would fight hard to keep themselves alive Remember that education isn’t strictly profit motivated like the other jobs I think what’s more likely is teachers will have some kind of AI assistant in the classroom

I disagree with the teachers one Yes you can get school online but hands on can never truly replace that one on one especially since jobs want actual skilled workers and not just degree spammers In school brick and mortar hands on experience is definitely here to stay unless it’s something like coding

For artists no Ai will ever be able to replace that Let me tell you why the Ai is programmed to use the most common used choice that sounds good or looks good It’s predictable “creativity” there is no actual creativity being programmed THAT is extremely hard to program Ai to be unique to draw from its owen reservoir in coding lol because you are programming it Yes they program Ai to do amazing creative work but creativewise its extremely limited its more technical then people realize You would have to get an actual artist to program there uniqueness into the Ai and then tell that artist you get no credit"

If 1 progress is 10 years x 400 researchers ai will save trillions of hours a year Especially if it comprrsses by 30x
AI will take your job your life and your legacy
So sad
Someone has to fix shit when it goes wrong AI will bring people face to face more
I prefer ai to learn a foreign language Try out PI its awesome
"Self driving cars will replace most drivers in 2024
Oh it did not okay then but the reports said"
Walmart and Dollar General can get rid of employees When I go in there I get all my own stuff and pay for it myself at self checkout No employees needed
Thats 85 million positions where we can find competent staff  You failed  Bring on AI
Teacher is already been replaced by youtubers dont tell me AI will not replace them it will
Think about something bigger  than just what happens on this planet Ai robots may replace us here but then we will be repositioned somewhere else in the universe
Of course they are What do you think the endless wars the nonstop pandemics and climate change are for The globalists want to lower the overall temperature around the world limiting the food supply and minimizing farms This will eliminate the surplus population It will be Soylent Green in our future If we the people survivefeeling lucky
I can see the future not made in China or not made by robots
Let’s say if ai will take these jobs then what
How is a it person safe
Will it swallow too
How come the dept of defense isnt affected by AI  but everyone else is confusedface
Not gonna happen WEF is going down
VALUE
I have AI Patrick Bet David looking over my profitability every week and  mentoring me to become better in my handyman business Ive also automated everything using Ai except our estimates and inperson work we do
I say its time to bring back Rage Against the Machine
So about thirty years ago I asked the question at a Business Round Table meetingHow does the economy function without a wage earning workforce Robots and AI dont earn wages Robots and AI dont buy goods and services Robots and AI dont contribute to 401ks which fuel a significant amount of the investment industry Robots and AI dont buy homes or rent apartments Robots and AI dont buy cars and trucks Robots and AI dont buy medical services Robots and AI dont need insurance Robots and AI dont buy education services And Robots and AI dont pay taxes since theyre not wage earners So when Robots and AI replace wage earning and tax paying workers how will the economy function Where will money come from Will businesses be forced to share their income and profits with the populace And since the marketplaces buying power will be lessened how will income and profits be generated A lot to think about How does a natural economy function with an unnatural workforce
It wont
Listen to what the powers that be are saying  They want to dumb us down and preoccupy us with drugs and entertainment as they slowly kill off large swaths of the population after using mankinds collective intelligence and energy to build the AI automation system that they will live off of  There is no plan for the future involving those who will be replaced by AI
This comment needs a boost You bring up a very valid concerning points
Excellent questions
I think just my opinion if the world comes to that extent it will mean you will have to surrender your freedom and allegiance to the power seated at that time Otherwise you cannot and will not function in the society and will be dead sooner or later It is the antichrist system as written in the Bible The antichrist who will rise to power will use economy to gain power and adornment and praise of most not all
This is the greatest elephant in the room We are constantly fucking bombarded with problems like overpopulation  climate change  and etc when there are clearly more important matters at hand and they clearly blow those problems out of proportion got me thinking that people in charge the real rulers dont have our interests in their minds
How can businesses stay open without customers  People are talking about UBI and etc but forget that we have to give away our privacy our motivations our pride and most importantly our freedom We dont own stuff we buy with money what do you think is going to happen when same people take over workforce 
I always asking this question but just maybe in my utopia dream for the first time human dont need to economize the resource and we have much resource and time for the for all human on earth and solution to our health and hunger problem And we can learn to trust each other and try to understanding each other for the first time
"you define the relative worth of an AIs effort then tax the business based on its use of AI labor  and then distribute that tax as a UBI to maintain a consumer based culturemuch as a business now pays for electricity water and other services it uses it would also pay  for the Use of AI labor 

would it actually  workhonestly who knows  as systems are messy and unpredictable at scale But there are several potential solutions for these types of scenarios just like the one described above"
your not really free now though eitheryour yoked to a job more likely than not that pays you less than you deserve doing a task you likely dont want to dojust so you can avoid living under a bridge and eating out of trash cans your freedom right now stops exactly at the point your bank account reaches zerothe  of people in a fulfilling job they rush to each morning that gives their life meaning is wayway smaller than you thinkAtomickPixel
We will need a new world order
dont worry governments will always find a way to tax you
When you have robots that can make you anything  you won’t need anyone to buy anything This will ensure only the rich survive  which is why we need to sue every company on that base of morality for doing this It’s genocide UBI will be the biggest trap  like welfare or whatever they call it these days  just enough to eat phone but not car no home no land Landhome will be the biggest asset you can havez
Payroll is commonly 70 expense overall at companies Replace humans with ai or robots be more efficient profitable without humans pay half of payroll  in UBI tax sign me up
I mean the consumers could be the stock owners in those mega cooperations trading goods and services between each other Naive to believe that you the not owning class will be needed in the futures
They wanted to eliminate human in bulk they dont want ur money or taxes
Given how the world and the society is organized today post AI economy would be simple Without the wages 95 of the population will starve to death skullandcrossbones believe me nobody cares Few lucky people end up in zoos or as slaves for the wealthy elite AI robot is not going to provide FREE lunch sandwich to anyone and the bar is going to be extremely high to survive and most of the humans aren’t going to make it
"Yes they need repairs aka health care
Constant R and D education 
Can be taxed
A lot of things we think are unique to human beings will be  common for robots as well 
Wont be long before they start talking about robots rights entertainment feelings marriage 
Not kidding"
well you could have asked the same question about horses and cars and agriculture 100 yrs ago when more than half of the population was employed by it  There is always some new job that will pop up
Youre thinking in the extreme  That AI will replace every job For a company to invest in AI and then automate their processes and replace a physical workforce takes real cash A lot of businesses will not be able to do this How many jobs changed or were replaced when the industrial revolution kicked off Weve been here before people Youre going to have to adapt
Simple solution to that They just dont Banks will just create money and not give it to us Leaving us to be homeless and learn to steal or kill for food and shelter The rich will always win
Just like the question I ask Trump supporters how does a free market economy function under a dictator
boristheamerican2938 Stay on topic if youre going to interject No one is talking about Trump or Biden or DemsRepublicans
Valid point but that brings us to the obvious At what point some will say once so many people become un utilized why would we still be needed
New ways of income distribution need to be designed eg Sports is one such
dakshMathscricketer In a workerless economy there will be no money making sports because basic income will not allow for discretionary spending on luxuries such as sports All of Basic income will be spent for food housing transportation and other necessities Nothing will be left over for sports So there will be no Sports money to redistribute
People will adapt like they always have Life goes on
New economy structure is needed capitalism communism and socialism wont work in Postlabour stage
There will be tough competition among AI and Robots companies There will be price war for products and services provided with Robots and AI The market will shrink substantially and unemployment will behigh Jobs available will be Agriculture dairy poultry
In this social media age humans have started living in isolation And its going to rise exponentially with advancements in AI and robotics Concept of marriage  reproducing and responsibilities are fading away in new generation So ultimately we dont need WW3 to make ourselves extinct We are already digging our own grave by becoming slaves of our material desires luxury etc   automation was supposed to buy us more time to be spent with our family Instead it made us impatient Today there is hardly any job in which client is patient That is why there is constant pressure to perform We are really messed up More of AI and automation will make us physically and mentally weak impatient irritating Love and take care of your family
Thank you for asking these thought provoking questions I wonder if our leaders have asked themselves these questions
pretty gullible line of questions considering all public available literature of where the world is headed and has been heading for decades and decades slave society depopulation smart islands for the elite armageddon for the masses you sound smart you should know this
Bold to assume that this economy is natural
Good observation I wanna see more of this
You are brilliant clappinghands Thanks for making me think thinkingface
fan4life345 Correct  it wont
trigger3939 As I put it to one of our suppliers who was hellbent to replace their workforce with automation those workers youre replacing with automation wont be able to buy our products and as a result we wont need as many materials from you He was shocked Nothing happens in a vacuum There are consequences and unintended consequences So how does a natural economy function with an unnatural workforce It doesnt without unnaturalartificial intervention
All the guys maintaining the servers and fixing the robots
Bout as bad as Bill Clintons NAFTA deal when they sold off Americas textile industryrember when America made its own clothes we were stronger than now All our stuff comes from other countries and we have to all go to a big chain to buy itWall Mart the destruction of America was and is intentional
it wont people will be living in tents and fighting for scraps some of them die from hunger others disease etc If you are not useful to the system you will just be gicen nothing and left to rot Once population will have decreased only those insane IT geniuses who know how to maintain the system will be left But we will probably be long dead by then
As far as the comment saying that businesses will be forced to share their income is the biggest joke in the world number one businesses have all the power over the government government is the slave to the rich therefore we are screwed
"This Robots and AI remind me of slavery the only difference is that the former can work 247 slaves are still human and need sleeprest its a huge reason why the South didnt win the US Civil War that no one talks about the South wasnt as industrialized as the North was cuz the North by this point had gotten rid of Slavery and thus people worked and made money and more money meant more industry and economies  North had better guns more resources and more time for trainingorganizing South needed whatever they could get their hands on  There was no way the South was going to win the Civil War even with the more brilliant generals  

So what is my point in bringing up the Civil War  A Slave economy didnt generate as much wealth to go around it only served the Slave lords whereas a true capitalist economy generated wealth for everyone"
I foresee a corporatocracy in a cyberpunk dystopian future
facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy dont you worry as soon it will replace people your taxes will be higherups or hackers break them
No economy no profits for anyone No money for taxes no working government How do you share profits when there arent any and why would rich people all of a sudden start giving people money
timothylarson4587 This is the point of my comment an artificial workforce will eventually lead to a stagnate economy and as the artificial workforce expands putting more people out of work it will lead to a depressed economy Corporations will relocate outside of the US to avoid taxes The wealthy will relocate outside the US to avoid taxes and redistribution of their wealth For awhile governments will create an artificial economy UBI but as tax money is depleted their artificial economy will collapse The will lead to the collapse of organized society which in turn leads to social chaos eg crime black markets etc
johntowers1213 Understand that large business decisions are  based on taxes If US corporations are faced with a tax to support an artificial economy such as UBI then they will relocate outside the US
roninatlantaexactly people are not just producers workers are also consumers take away consumption you dont need any workers you dont need any AI
jawid2058 The transitional job theory has worked in the past because jobs were not completely eliminated The extinction of one industry often led to job creation in another But truthfully that changed beginning in the 70s when textile jobs predominantly in the South were exported offshore resulting in local economies nearly failing and never recovering because the workers couldnt transition to other jobs The same is true for the Rust Belt Those industrial workers never replaced their jobs because there were no jobs for them to transition to They had to find and take lessor employment And as a result the economies of that region has never fully recovered from the loss of jobs
bantheshift AI doesnt have to replace every job to have an extreme impact on the economy By economic definition when unemployment reaches  ten percent  the economy is in a depression During the Great Depression unemployment reached 25 percent Meaning that 75 percent of the workforce were still employed But 25 percent of the workforce being without income brought the US to its knees for a decade
"roninatlanta which is combated by using trade tariffs to discourage such behavior

manufactures cant have it both ways they cant participate in a system that removes the wide scale need for employment to their financial benefit  and still have a customer base with money to buy their productnow they may wish to reap the benefit without paying the cost but its foolish to think such a system would last for very long

which is where the UBI comes in  those manufactures still reap a substantial benefit by the removal of a large chunk  paid staff but some of that saving needs to be retained and redistributed to keep the wheels on the bus turning to maintain a consumer base with a capability to actually keep consuming"
"johntowers1213 So hypothetically ACME is the global leader in Widgets and ACME is going to give customers the money to buy their Widgets and that money comes from the savings of employing AI and Robots rather humans So the money that ACME saves from not employing humans will be redistributed to humans 

Got It"
"we will not use money anymore simple as that we get what we want
i dont understand people why we are so into a paper money"
"supritiphani1282 this question has been solve way before pandemic 
but people dont like the idea of Klaus schwab"
gretcynlopez Lol No things wont be free Youll have to have something of value you can exchange for the stuff you want May not be paper money but there will be something of value which people exchange  Sorry
"I can only think of two possibilities
1 it doesnt work and a new system is needed
2 Instead of people pay the state the state pays people to have money to spend"
xeviusUsagi Without workers paying taxes to the government the government doesnt have money to pay anyone
Accountwe2go For UBI to work the government has to have taxes it can redistribute As AI and Robotics replace jobs income taxes paid to the government will be less and lessthus there will be less money for UBI That will force government to substantially raise businesscorporate tax which will then put some out of business and others to move their operations offshore And it will add to the unemployment and put even more pressure on the government and UBI I foresee a depressed economy fueling more subculture economies and black markets coupled with unbridled crime if we dont come to understand the role of the human workforce in the economy and stop the wild  eyed thinking that tech can replace humans and reduce costs and soar profitability
It will a Universal Basic Income
While CoPilot technology has been developed the actual AI is probably still in the research phase and has not progressed
The US has taken advantage of the tracking business set up by China and has grown into a large market People continue to have their information stolen Because they are dumb
Universal payments  Tax the rich to pay for itsmilingfacewithsmilingeyes
keithwisdom1663 The sad truth is the rich will either be gone from the US or theyll soon be poor Either way therell be no money from the Rich to pay everyone a UBI Its utopian to think Ah well take from the Rich and give to everyone else But believing in utopia is for children and fools
My guess is that there wont be any economy and well be ruled by a dictator
Pretty easily actually workers will buy from companies that dont use robots aka workers will buy from companies that pay their workers workers paying workers Think bakers people will go to a local bakery with a human instead of buying a bread produced by 0 humans And companies that use robots will go bankrupt cause no one will buy from them
Also its unlikely this will happen worldwide so if one country starts having a high unemployment the workers will just move to a different country governments will collapse wars will errupt AI and robots will be the last of our issues when people start losing jobs
All these business owners want Robots and AI as they wont ask for salaries but want the consumer to be 100 Human Being why  Just because Robots AI want pay for the products since they dont earn money
Dude you need to go to Japan
So far I havent seen ai that can do more than predict words and sentences using math there is no real thinking like a human brain so far
MickyMaxdg8ub Which is why they call it Artificial because its not real or natural by any sense AI lacks natural reasoning ability
It will function for few rich billionaires and powerful politicians while rest of the population will be working on fields or as construction worker and will be paid in form of food clothing and probably some medical facilities or may be not overall human population will be reduced below 1 billion from famine war disease destruction
Ive heard several good solutions put forth Probably the best place to start is look up Ben Shapiro not that one the other one He has a whole channel dealing with those exact points you are asking about Very well detailed and he welcomes questions and discussion It is rather optimistic predictions and not the doom and gloom extremely popular now But might provide you a sense for the possibilities
आज के युग में सब चीज बहुत तेजी से हो रही है जो कि पहले कभी नहीं हुआ था। इसके दुष्परिणाम हमें भविष्य में देखने को मिलेंगे।
We will all be farmers again Nobody needs technology anymore cuz nobody can afford it anyway Back to nature love animals 3
Exactly How does a consumer driven economy function when there is no one left to consume
gordonallen9095 according to all Ive heard the plan is UBI So you will still be a consumer Rather it works is yet to be seen Its supported by a VAT They have done many trials Alaska has a small version of such Oil pays tax as payment for drilling and Alaska distributes that to each citizen annually Businesses would pay tax on goods produced with the use of automation and it would be distributed to all citizens in theory Yang ran on just such a proposal every tech company has been campaigning for it
gordonallen9095 I think well see the rise of subculture and black markets Even black offthegrid labor markets Prohibition is the model we should all be looking at Banning alcohol created a subculture economy organized crime which society is still contending with today A 100 years later
roninatlanta A labor market based on the prohibition eras Thats an interesting hypothesis But in an economy that is no longer labor intense or consumer driven what would be the market for this labor In a world driven by AI automation and robotics labor wouldnt be so much prohibited as simply rendered obsolete But I agree that some type of underground economy could evolve to fill some economic needs of the masses Especially in a dystopian economy where the few control the majority of the wealth and the rest of us merely exist on the crumbs thrown to us by the plutocracy who would be in control The shrinking of the middle class coupled with the swelling ranks of the indigent poor and working poor on one side and the slowly increasing amount of rich alongside a small core of immensely wealthy people on the other side of the spectrum with little inbetween seems to be the way were going Not just here but in other parts of the developed world as well IMO this would be the prelude to mass social upheaval if you look at history Or AI and automation could create new jobs for workers keeping our economy consumer driven As a Boomer I probably wont be here to see the how this all turns out eventually
gordonallen9095 universal income but how will it be financed
shairaptor1865 Thats the million dollar question
gordonallen9095 The reason I bring up the era of Prohibition is because it was the great test of trying to socially engineer American society and it failed and failed miserably Anyone thinking about changing American society should thoroughly study Prohibition and its unintended consequences Instead todays technocrat elites are drunk on digital technology and like the Prohibitionists falsely believe they can changecontrol human behavior Back then people found ways to drink and in a techno dominated society people will find ways to get money and consume But it will be nasty and lawless
"It’s not that concerning Ai is still limited on what it can create due to requiring initial input to make something new Jobs will move to the direction of creation and expression  More artist  scientists and engineers More research based jobs will become the norm Also a universal income will probably go into effect  Also human kind will leave this planet soon  Ai will
Never be able to fully take over an economy will cost way to much to put them into everything "
​AtomickPixelHow about digital currency 
AtomickPixelyou’d still own the stuff you’d buy with your UBI Don’t be delusional They’re not gonna outlaw private ownership
We unfortunately live with people who think this is “good” and is just like the “Industrial Revolution” People are exited about not doing anything and getting universal income They don’t know they will soon be real slaves
johntowers1213they don’t even dustribute tax now and they actually print so much money that even the little you have left after taxes is worth nothing
jawid2058 You’re comparing apples to monkeys What new jobs would be created 
drivingforcebehinduThe woke AI are coming rollingonthefloorlaughing
roninatlantaKind of like we’re seeing now in California and New York
gretcynlopezSweden is already cashless  They created their own Bitcoin Their cash in in museums for future generations to see
Yes we can derive a system for this  Low amount of population is something we are facing for a long time and in distant future low population and low productivity hence AI at initial will focus at these as to increase the productivity and later with much leap into AI new employment sector will open up and the work force will shift to that example space sector Ai related fields such as new time will be created as AI coders simulation and training models will become the software engineer jobs and more focus will be given to robotics field and the population will shift to that direction and gen zs and alpha gen will have plenty of time to adapt to these new times and back again the economy will move See all jobs are not software engineers coders there are plenty of other jobs which will be highlighted and population will also move to that side Some jobs will be completely extinct but individuals can thrive if they are able to integrate AI onto that field and able to squeeze some time which they can use it to build sustainable business or careers How to integrate Ai Well that is the answer you are all looking then it can be found by absorbing knowledges and deriving formulae in your brain
It doesnt at least not if its going to remain capitalist
Easy  they dont need so many people there is plan for depopulation and its implemented long time ago
"Youre missing something AI is not created for things like the economy  making money et cetera It is created for just a few very powerful families They will have fully automated factories that can make anything they want and bring it to their mansions They always wanted everything and now they see the window of opportunity  to make it happen We the ordinary people are vermin to them

Of course it is a stupid fantasy just like transhumanism AI is a hype People dont realise how fragile our technology is 
AI is like a tightrope walker When you first see it you think wow how is this possible  Now imagine a tightrope walker walking the rope for decades One day he will fall and if he falls he will fall hard 
Now we see a Tesla driving itself and we think wow how is this possible while utopian dreamers like Yuval Harari telling us that the computer and the cloud services are superior to humans but one glitch or hack or EMP is enough to create a world wide catastrophic event 
It wont take long before the masses start to see how fragile these systems are 

Btw Anyone starting to notice that AI generated art becomes boring very fast"
The bigger question is why are we letting this happen Shouldn’t we be up in arms
My comment disappeared
but there must be people make robot maintain robot and the other tge more robot is used the more type of jobs created
KDYinYouTube in the transhumanist fantasy making and maintaining robots is done by robots or cyborgs
Businesses shouldnt be allowed to use AI in a way that replaces workers Period
bantheshiftbingo
We are already working for free for Opac by filling our cars
UBI which is short for slavery
dred8616 Agree
You do the big thinky thinky
They dont care about u
We will die while they live in a eutopia
"Thats true 
Same question I have"
Maybe with the efficiency of technology the world will not need the same infrastructure as we know it today
I was going to say the exact same thing grinningfacewithsweat honestly Ive thought about it so much whenever I hear this and my go to argument whenever I hear anyone say that Long term it just aint going to work because its not how the economy functions
thomasjarman7361 Ponder this the infrastructure of Sellers and Buyers preceded and have survived the wheel printing press Jesus Greeks Romans the Dark Ages the Reformation the Rennasaince Wars Revolutions Civil Wars World Wars Cold Wars industrial revolution the Air Age the Space Age the Information Age the Digital Age and it will somehow survive  the AI Age
Beautiful questions my friend Short answer it wont happen People are being hoodwinked in broad daylight
muhammadaulia5298 Yes please lets abolish this horrible economic model
And what funds UBI Taxing existing businesses is not going to be enough  And if you think the rich billionaires are going to pay for UBI from their wealth than Ive got some moon property to sell you
Capitalism and AI doesn’t work AI will replace majority of everyone in the end
Ai is the end of humanity
It wont be China taking away your jobs It will be AI Hooray for American tech
Mark my prediction 2025 will be the actual beginning of the AI era better than the basic we have seen we saw the first telephone and it was amazing until they released the iPhone what we have is telephone And it wont be until 810 years till the AI starts affecting job on a large scale the people are claiming 2025 will be the beginning of the multimodal AIdecent modal not the crap we have now If course in 57 years there will be protests and slowing down of development and court hearing and meeting like they do with social media platforms now So Id say most jobs should be safe for atleast next 10 years 2035 the shxt hits the fan The year we would see major upgrade in the robotic industry and the evolution of AI into something much great 2026 a pretty dependable video generation modal by 2028 lots of industries will begin to implement and integrate AI on large scale 2030 AI goes everywhere on all devices even specialized home ai and if course we would have way better AI contect prediction tools and tons of rules on AI content which would all fade start fading away around 2050 the guy from 2051
Lol prompt engineer I’m dead
"I seek refuge in God from the accursed Devil

Due to the above verse the practice of isti‘adhah is considered an obligation according to some the majority of scholars however hold it to be recommended The key here is that such words should be uttered with understanding fahm and presence of heart hudur alqalb rather than as a heedless sacrament or empty ritual

So what is it that we are to apprehend and bring into our heart when seeking sanctuary and refuge from Satan the outcast

If we recall that the word Satan shaytan is derived from the Arabic word shatana – ‘to be far” or “made distant” from God then just as Satan through his arrogance and contempt was repudiated and made an outcast from Allah’s grace honour and heaven that is what he wants for everyone else too especially Man After his banishment in his spite malice and jealous rage he set himself in opposition to Allah and to the utter ruin of humanity Hence the Qur’an frequently describes him as ‘aduwwun mubin – “a clear enemy” to us In fact he is “the Enemy”

Satan is evil and devilry personified He and his entourage are not the civil though utterly conniving creatures so cleverly depicted in CS Lewis’ The Screwtape Letter His hatred malevolence and demonic designs against mankind – that have lasted for uncounted ages and will continue till God gives him respite no more – can never be underestimated That he is longlived cunning and unseen and who whispers into the breasts of men Q1145 makes him an enemy that we by ourselves can never hope to defeat Hence it is with this recognition of our inability and of our neediness in Allah’s might and mercy that we seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Devil And it is because Allah alone is AllPoweful AllInvincible AllKnowing and He cares for our welfare that we direct our broken pleas of protection to Him and none other And once Allah brings home to the believer his or her inability and inspires them to sincerely seek refuge in Him when intending to recite the Qur’an the believer is under divine protection and is gifted the halawah altilawah – “the sweetness of recitation and reflection”

One hadith informs us that ‘Indeed Satan runs through the son of Adam as does blood’ Muslim no2174 These devilish whisperings that circulate in us and influence our heart and thoughts have an end desire to make us slide into disbelief kufr by causing doubts about God or the core articles of faith if not then to tempt us into sin and away from acts of obedience to God and if even that is not possible then to corrupt our worship or good deeds through ostentation riya’ or selfconceit ‘ujb

SPIRITUAL BENEFIT

Our spiritual masters teach us that there are four main qawati‘ or things which cut us off from Allah or obstacles that impede us from drawing closer to Him the devil shaytan the ego nafs worldliness dunya and people khalq The cure from the Devil and his subtle whisperings is to seek refuge in Allah from him and oppose his insinuations The cure for the ego lies in taming it and training it The cure for worldliness is to nurture a sense of zuhd or worldly detachment in our hearts and lives aspiring more to Allah and the Afterlife And the cure for people lies in not socialising too much with them allowing one to have regular periods of spiritual seclusion ‘uzlah wherein the heart’s gaze can be focused on God"
thats why i have no choice but to become a multi billionaire
My job is already being replaced and I dont know what to do other than to fall into despair Im a fully qualified translator and the volume of work that Ive been getting this year has been slashed by more than 60 I cant even begin to fathom how my industry will be like 12 months from now cryingface
jjkigtu Thank you
Start thinking on what your next step could be Do you have any other interest or is there another industry you might be learning new skills for
fayebulous My passion has always being languages Im a bit lost right now I guess I need to find another passion one that I can afford Thanks for your kind wordsredheart
You always could learn language of robot that means python and other prigramming language loveyougesture
what about language teaching   its the most obvious sidestep for your skillset
johntowers1213 That could an option Will do some research on what teaching certificate to get Probably TEFL for English and another one in my mother tongue to teach foreigners Thanks for the adviceredheart
You could look into becoming an interpreter for real time spoken language translations AI wont be able to accurately translate speech in real time for a long time Heck it doesnt even transcribe English speech correctly when people dont speak clearly or when they speak with a difficult accent
Nightzo I was actually going to start a postgraduate course in simultaneous interpreting in August last year and was strongly advised against it as apparently Teams has a subtitling function that is very accurate it As the person talks the subtitles appear in realtime so I think by the time my course would be finished a 2year course this job would also be gone by then which is a shame as I worked as a community and  police interpreter in the UK and I loved the job And it is also very well paid at the moment But not for long
Open an AI agency to replace the rest of translators
Yea my contacts in the gaming industry said there is no chance someone will hire real people for translating or voice over in the next 3 years in the industry
Have you considered working closer to people as an interpreter
"My heart goes out to you I translate French literature to English in my spare time I have always used some machine assistance but I tend to go without as much as possible

I will say that although chatbots do a good job at least in matters of literature you cannot remove the creative writer from the process if you want to create a truly inspired translation That takes the skills of a novelist and linguist and a whole lot of human creativity

For now I let the AI have the first pass but Im the quality pass"
MrAnt1V1rus I used to be a community interpreter and loved the job Unfortunately the rates paid by agencies are so outrageously low that it is impossible to make ends meet which is why I switched to translation
"peaceandlove713 I know that learning to use AI and automation is an almost disgusting suggestion at this moment but go with me for a moment I work in IT and I am also seeing changes in this business Changes that could turn me into a dinosaur if I am not careful Fortunately I am far to clever for that  

My role in IT is to implement technology on behalf of business owners so they can get their work done without  and this is key  without having to ever think in technical terms They keep their minds on their business and I help them by understanding and providing solutions

For me this means I need to leverage AI myself understand everything about how to implement and deploy it so that I can still be an indispensable part of the mission at whatever business Im partnered with For me its just a call to learn and grow but I think Ill still be here for a long time

Translators and interpreters enable effective communication between businesses that dont share a language I think theres room for you to execute that role by providing some technologies yourself Either of your own design or by using off the shelf solutions I would try to lean into providing deeper partnerships with businesses in person present on meetings willing to take on keeping documentation libraries in two languages in real time Integrating translation into email etc

I guess my instinct here is to try to be more live more present more in person and also to use the technology for yourself instead of being run over by it which is unfortunately what happens too often"
Have you seen the ai pin sorry I would look in to a job that requires a full time work at a school working with children So of them have just got to the country and need help
Nightzo No not only will it translate real time it will change the persons mouth movements to match the speech that is already almost here
Lol it already does thoNightzo
Time to learn some new skills
Sorry to hear that Could you retrain as a plumber that will probably be the hardest to replace
muhammadaulia5298Haha except AI is going to replace programmers too facewithtearsofjoy
johntowers1213Teaching will be replaced too but maybe that will take longer
mikezooper Im with you on that its almost inevitable at this point though there is still a window of opportunity to use something like language skills for the next Decade or so maybe  within a formal school setting but yeah  pretty much any soley knowledge based skill is in for a pretty rough ride going forward
peaceandlove713reroll in markets like housing   food or tourism You like languages  Learn to become a real estate agent that speaks multiple languages for foreign customers Markets that include stuff that all humans need or where there is human interaction will never go away Apply your love for languages on these new markets Or  not to be ironically dystopian in your particular case ask an AI what you could in your situation I’m pretty sure it ll come up with a brilliant awnser Best to you
yeah all the LLM models are designed to get you to eat shite But I am not sorry for you because we have been aware that this was going on from 2017 you should have reinvented yourself instead being crying now
domenicorutigliano9717 Spoken like a true heartless and selfcentred Italian I couldnt care less about your pity The world the not revolve around your selfcentred bellybutton
domenicorutigliano9717 I couldnt care less about your pity You mean nothing to me so you can shove your lack of sorry up where the sun doesnt shine
Keep on swimming smilingfacewithsmilingeyes  and trust in God he will listen to your needs Stay strong and have hope

Start teaching languages to folks Start a business…or maybe also a YouTube channel devoted to learning languages
But Google translates every language for free so what is your Skill 
The US has taken advantage of the tracking business set up by China and has grown into a large market People continue to have their information stolen Because they are dumb
​peaceandlove713you could possibly change the job title to teaching languages or setting yourself up as a tour guide in the areas that you know these languages in
Companies such as Uber offers LLM tasks that evaluate translation and provide evaluation of content in general for example What is considered harmful information perhaps you are interested in this too They could offer you full time work but I am afraid you would have to have a extremely impressive CV in order to have a chance
peaceandlove713 You can create a team for Indian languages if you still have some money I know that machine translation is not working for Indian languages yet You can also help IT companies to collect data and provide annotation service as well you can earn a decent amount of money as well
relaxandlearn7996 I have still heard that someone still receive stable workload for game translation is that getting uncommon for most people now
If you are a translator get into the government realm if you can obtain security clearance   I think it wont get replaced by any time soon 
Guess what real people are needed to review the AI outputs and asses the results of such If you are fluent in several languages you could probably use those skills to help the developers improve and troubleshoot the models Not a long term solution I know but perhaps long enough for you to reassess and find other avenues to pursue
GPT4o will be public soon damn best of luck to you foldedhands
Dont worry GPT4o has got released recently No more translator job for sure
Do you have a niche Or were you general translator
What state you live in The demographics play a part in this as wellhundredpoints
Start looking into where your company has their business license to sell and practice in If youre in the US you can write to the representatives of those states to pass into law an antiAI replacement policy Or get lawmakers to enforce skyhigh fees for companies to use AI If your employer is going to hurt you in the pocket book cement theirs shut until they allow you a livable working environment Everyone on here says Oh youll just have to adapt Consider this adapting
If youre in the US look into which states your company gets its business license from Write to those representatives and get them to pass antiAI workforce replacement bills or impose skyhigh fees for companies that use AI If your company is going to attack your pocket book cement theirs shut until you have a liveable working environment Everyone on this thread says things like Learn to adapt Consider this adapting
Robot is a soldier any computer follow the orders of the program There is no robot doing everything a person can do no robot can do what an ant spider or bee can do Ai is completely missing at high level leadership not taking jobs in nato wef eu who un not even in intelligence or security agencies They are only you to be replaced and this means jobs and business vanished because someone decided that we are too many Now need better mentality forget about money nobody can eat or breathe money billionaires have loads of money but still unhappy we are not just mechanic architects lawyers we can do many things but eyes and ears must not be covered brain and thinking must be unlocked we can find solutions to many problems but first must find who are you and discover potential Life isnt about eating sleeping drinking feeling good That any animal or insect can do
muhammadaulia5298AI is already better at programming than people
This just happened at work few months ago Our QA department before we have 5 people doing the testing now there are only 2 person running the show after automation was implemented But the rest of them were trained to become software engineer and Data Analyst
Man look at all that sex you missed budcryingface Just for ALL that All in the name of money
"This is great news
Evil always wins"
If there isnt enough people with jobs to buy things from all these companies replacing workers with AI then theyll all have reduced profits or go out of business from lack of customers imo
"Pffft  AI are glorified chatbots and cant use any advantageous discernment  If youre somehow still a Democrat  Yeah be scared

 For all the real people have no fear the machines are proven to be too biased to replace you"
Good take all the jobs Let’s get everyone riled up and force them to take back the country They won’t have anything else do to if they don’t have a job
"In the whispers of tomorrow a revolution unfurls
As AIs shadow looms with its mechanized whirls
Patrick BetDavid ponders as the future swirls
How many jobs will vanish as the digital world hurls

Robots with their precision in circuits they weave
Into the fabric of labor they steadily cleave
Will they replace our roles Will they silently deceive
As the AI revolution its power achieves

In factories and offices where humans toil
AIs presence grows with an insatiable coil
Will it render us obsolete Will it rob us of our toil
As the AI revolution in its relentless roil

Prophetic visions dance in the poets quill
As the AI revolution bends to its will
Will it bring liberation or a bitter pill
As jobs disappear with a mechanical thrill

In the echoes of uncertainty humanity stands
Contemplating the future with trembling hands
Will robots take our jobs in vast digital sands
As the AI revolution across the world expands

So let us ponder with a thoughtful eye
The impact of AI as it soars to the sky
Will it bring prosperity or will it bid goodbye
To the jobs we hold dear as the years go by"
Goood It will be better more efficient in administrative type of jobs than humans
Retail automated Isn’t that a leading field for those non high school graduates The ones least impacted Hmm
Im pushing 70 yrs old now but I sure wish I was 30 again  such exciting times ahead  Id be all over this AI stuff  As it is I have about 20 LLMs stored on my laptop that generates cool stories for me to read and insanely cool art All for free
Im 53 and good I can sit this out and just watch facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy Early retirement soon

"the chart shows working with your hands will be safe and working with a computer will be obsolete
bottom line is its who you know not what you know when these jobs get scarce"
jjkigtu not really someone cant do these jobs and will be filtered out fast already happens now some people not made for for the trades
GOD is a purest science because no bodies can create and make like a nature without giving harmful for any human being and animals and birds and plants and others If you see our recent nnovations by the research teams are foolish and against human being and their wellness why for AI to this world even we have enough human to deploy all jobs Always we are telling about fraud European people to create duplicate means fraud against nature  and AI technology is against for this world People are not sensing about our earth and protection and human and other being wellness Prayer and meditation are must to bring light in this world from GOD and all the siddhas from all the culture to remove darkness or negativity from this world because some team are continually trying to destroy this world but we are not sensing and unnecessaryly spending time in entertainment same time their deployed research team is gather information and creating fraud and duplicate creation against people to make confusion and suffering and hiding true history and truth text No use of UN and there is no regulation and control over AI technology product Elon musk is a son of saithan because even their Jesus wont like this type of ugly creation against nature
Bullshit 85 will not replace shit Bullshit Ai wont hurt me at all
Hey if a robot can take over all retail jobs and allow us to stay home work free I’m cool with that In fact I wouldn’t mind if almost all jobs went to AI so that all of us can focus on our passions I think we’re moving past the stage when full time work is necessary Or we’re tired of working 40hrs  a week It’s time we have shorter work weeks and more time to live a little We’re the most advanced species on planet earth aside from the aliens we all know are probably here shouldn’t we move past needing survival mode to stay on top Just saying
The conundrum is if these companies replace their workforce with AI who will have money to shop or spend for services at said businesses  The new labor force will be people who repair and maintain AI and robots
a portion of the wealth generated by those that use an AI workforce gets distributed to the entire population to maintain a basic consumer economy
AI cant weld so no
BY BY LAZY PEOPLE ON APP IS COMING TO REPLACE YOU
This is just the beginning It will only get worse Eventually we will question what it means to be human This will be the greatest threat we ever faced and it is one we created And since we allowed it we deserve
We as a whole dont deserve it After all none of us asked to be born in this world and play this expensive game called life The people who deserve it are the ones causing it
theintrovertedaspie9095 we deserve it because were doing nothing to stop it Were not even protesting about it
"Trinison7 Thats because 

A Some people like the idea of AI
B Some people are too ignorant to naive  to care 
C At the end of the day theres not much anything can do about it Some are just too scared"
theintrovertedaspie9095 but all people who see it as a problem are doing nothing about it or speaking out Or demand that governments  do something
Trinison7 Thats because the government has all the power The industries or corporations probobly bribe them into going along with their ideas Part of being insanely wealthy is that you can use your billions to buy political influence In short ordinary people who dont like AI taking over jobs have very little control or say in this Plus they maybe over ruled or outnumbered by the  millions of people who like AI
theintrovertedaspie9095 since one that has stopped protesting bra From civil rights To recently when they overturned roe v Wade That point does not stop people from going out in the streets and protesting We should be protesting this Making it clear that theres a huge opposition to this AI and robotics But were not doing any sort of  thing Outside of my YouTube content creator videos The time we will protest is when its too late and its already a huge problem And with this final point Im done  You can have the last word
Trinison7 This isnt about have the last word Its about understanding why it feels like nobody is doing anything to stop AI from taking over Thats all Im against this as much as you are Im an aspiring author AI can be good and it could be bad But this system we live in was designed to benefit the rich So if AI does take over and when ever theres a recession pandemic or hyper inflation session guess whos gonna truly feel the impactthe ordinary people
Atp what is even the point of living
Bro they need a stop with this ai shiit they didn’t learn about that google robot that attacked
AI is not all the hype we think it is  Using companies and customers to make money selling AI products to people  Elon mentioned it
"All legal aspects can be replaced but they wont do it bcuz of the obvious Racism  Power Any jobs that deals with numbers processes policies  writing can be replaced Law is written  its black  white so AI can replace Attorneys  Judges but I like how that made sure they keep their jobs bcuz its a Power Position which hold Racial Powers 

Law field is racial  it is the most powerful industry in the worldthe world is ran off Law Again the law is Black  White meaning its either lawful or unlawful its either legal or illegalno need for interpretation bcuz interpretation is the gray area that is used to defraud  manipulate  

Do yall see how this is the biggest problem  Transparency in law  the programming of the AI is how you can prevent the deception in AI  Law Pass laws to penalize those who alter manipulate  or defraud the People of America rather intentional or unintentionally thats how you are to make this AI thing work"

nope it wont this guy just needs views
Bla bla bla blaIts a zero sum flawed game that relies on infinite economic growth We need to do better in a post AGI society Our obssesion with productivity and efficiency is becoming a mass psychosis Countless of interesting and meaningful jobs are about to be destroyed and for what For bigger profits to the top 1 Well done sociopaths

They want to replace us with the AI robots because that way then they dont have to put no Revenue out towards us and then well shut us all out from giving money to us or paying us to do a job
So why are we allowing all these illegals if all these jobs are disappearing

So AI is like perfect indestructible never have any kind of errors never have any kind of  issues stupid as hell everything needs maintenance

have you not just sidestepped into another career path thats equally on the chopping block for replacement though
Hate to break it to you but analysts are pretty easy to replace with AI actually there isnt any job thats safe Also AI evolves exponentially so that AGI by 2030 might be by next month and in another week ASI thats basically God compared to us hopefully it wont be that fast but it wont take years Invest in survival skills next

MrAnt1V1rus jobs that will be booming are service types businesses like the fitness industry a personal trainernutritionist or things like a life coachbusiness coach an advertising agency etc these are things that will be around for a while where a human cant really be replaced   the future ahead will be about how can you help others help themselves  anything self interested like a normal 95 job it will all be replaced by robots  picking something were people actually need you to help them a job that requires real human interaction that is where the jobs will be atleast for a while hopfully a few decades the only thing with that is how long will humans want to still interact with another human thats the question as the decades pass more people are detached even myself im only 30 literally born in the year of the internets boom 1993 i hope robots wont be able to take everything tho ive seen many movies of bots taking away so many things and a good view of how the ones in power want things to look like no more middle class just rich and poor quite unsetteling we have till around 2027 to prepare better for whats to come

It is bumming me out I have been in video production for over 20 years and now it looks like my career is under threat This needs to be regulated Why are people running for office not talking about this They have never said anything for many years
"This has been talked about for many years CGP Grey made a video called Humans Need Not Apply almost 10 years ago talking about this scenario 
Philosophers and many others have theorized about this scenario since like the late 1800s The luddites are a good example from a time of great upheaval where they thought all the machines were gonna take over their jobs
The reason why this was never talked about in a political sense is because until recently most thought AI would never reach a point where it could do these tasks and start replacing jobs Even when I was studying AI in college and talking to my AI professors they were split 5050 on the efficacy of AI 
Not to mention that most of the AI being talked about are LLMs and thats only one facet of machine learning so theres many others that need to be explored
In short dont expect the government to keep up with whats changing in the field Even experts are having a hard time with it so I dont expect old fogeys who have a hard time with browsing the internet on their phones to get a handle on this"
Big business paying politicians
You dont pay attention to news they have been saying it needs to be regulated but now they want to use it for war
Why should it be “regulated”
This is kinda conspiratorial but I believe they’re already testing ubi in certain populations Like New York migrants and in certain areas of Europe

Thank you
Why do you think covid was released into the population
Those jobs are absolutely NOT safe
Not everything in life is leverage Only if you are looking at it from materialistic perspective
I think people are really missing whats  going to be the real issue The people who are going to lose their jobs are not just employees These people are taxpayers and customers Business doesnt exist without customers People cannot purchase a product or service without money This country needs tax dollars to survive which they will loose when people are unemployed There are no police departments fire department schools and SSI without income tax  The people left with jobs will not generate enough to run this country Also people with a decent stash of money can pack up and leave the us
This makes so much sense no wonder the birth rate is falling there will be no more need to make so many humans It is as if they knew that this will happen Well the future is bright for the human race but I dont think many will like the light that the top 1 are giving to the rest of us
Fear mongering will go away too Come on AI take all the jobs hope you going to buy the product you produce also Haha rollingonthefloorlaughing Government has to provide universal income and business will be happy to pay the taxes because they only can stay in business if people buy the product or services they providing with AI
So what will they do with all the extra people

Sounds like the tech sector is about get a reckoning by ai
Im sure America can conjure up a convoluted scheme where AI jobs are not allowed here
Sweet ppl cant get my order right anyway Maybe a robot can
Whos going to be customers when AI replaces all the jobs example fast food the majority of the people who shop at McDonalds or lower middle class or lower class kind of people who work at fast food restaurants and their families I dont believe you get a lot of CEOs Tech industry engineers and surgeons stoping buy McDonalds their clients are  primarily really uneducated lowincome workers so if you replace your employees with robots and your employees are also majority of your customers then who is purchasing the products

I am working on a vax film industry for the past 11 years and I can confirm AI generated video at first look are great  considering how fast and simple is to create them  but after a second view there are full of errors and in the film industry a single shot  we talking 24 fps can go on and on and on not been finalised after 20 reviewed frame by frame I reckon AI will speed up the process and for sure teams will require less artist

Thanks Pat but the report is already outdated because AGI is already on the rise AGI will do everything better Your advice to compete will only help people to have an edge when they fight for the crumbs amongst each other AI job replacement will bring poverty civil unrest and violence from a government towards its own civilians when it has to uphold the law and protect AI dominated property from impoverished civialins The later you see it the slimmer the chances of survival for humanity Your advice is short term good but long term fatally bad

Computer systems analyst Im pretty sure this will be automated as well In the previous company I worked for they replaced all the level 1 techs and created a robot that can do basic troubleshooting and escalate to a Level2 tech if nothing works IMO these type of self servicerobots will only get better with time to the point theyll eventually replace most of those type of jobs
It’s alarming how many people are using the UBI cope Why would the most powerful people In the world want to take care of an underling class that doesn’t produce anything of valve They won’t It’s scary no one thinks about the repercussions of this stuff
Yes we rely on the elites system for food shelter and medicine add funny things into those and people would not be here long enough to be a problem healthy enough to rebel or old enough to get pension and cheapest way for them to solve the problem UBI may still be here  to stop people from rebelling short term but it would not be the elites long term solution It would be here until the three scenarios I mentioned occurred to most people

"Also its not about The same content as 4 years ago and people already knowing what you stand for AT ALL Most adults X gen and older have abandoned social media completely now This is rhe actual truth
1 The average YouTube userviewer is no older than 27 yrs of age now
2 Short form content has erroded the attention span of younger usersviewers of YouTube and other platforms to around a maximum of 2mins 30 seconds at most now 
3 There has been a 30 point generational drop in intelligence starting with the Millennial Y generation and is dropping at an exponential rate with the Z and Alpha generations as well Those numbers still havent been publshed but are more than the Y gen statistics in current tests of Z and now Alpha generations
4 Missinformation Disinformation and the modern day media with the insanity woke and mentally deranged agenda
5 YouTube as a platform is too heavily advertised on now as well

The IOT is dying due to clutter all the above and an utter lack of easily accessible meaningful information anymore Its a semsory overload for ALL partys involved

Then you have the sheep mentality of younger generations ontop starting with Y gen to Alpha gen currently Noone dares be an individual or push against the popular opinion as noone wants to be bullied online and cyber hated on either

Your video is yet another of these clutter pieces that has not taken the time to research their content and spoken to a non receptive audience All of you that do not cover whats actually current and important with your opinion pieces are lost in the white noise of the internet All of us that actually use YouTube and make content as its intended with proof facts and evidence to educate an audience on YouTube also go ignored and also are enveloped by the white noise like your channel makes on this platform as well 

The unfortunate fact is that the IOT is dying due to useless content for views and clicks for money and the original purpose and intention for this paltforms use case has got lost in that time as well 

YouTube needs to clean house and shut down ANY channel thats making false or misleading statements or providing information thats illegal or contradictory to actual evidence based facts on paper now Opinions have destroyed society With that we have generational losses in IQ along with it We ARE heading towards utter Idiocracy as a species now 

These are just medical scientific and academic facts on paper Say what you want but your opinions can not and will not be able to argue against fact based proven research at this stage Plain and simple There is NO excuse for ignorance in todays emerging AI reality Get onboard or enjoy your cardboard box in the next few years"
Teachers will absolutely be replaced by AI Plenty of startups in that space already Only a matter of the leftleaning teachers union a couple years from now In regards to everything else Patrick said — 100 Coming from a data scientist
Im a technical and profession College Teacher myself I know for an actual fact that education will be fully abolished with the advent of ASI Human teachers are simply not effective Todays kids and what they are doing in schools perfect example Cmon ASI will without doubt replace ALL human educators and thats just a statistical fact at this stage The impact of humanity and the workforce will be revolutionary 95 of the workforce will be made redundant by 2040 If you have ANY techcical or education experience or have worked in IT youd see this as a glaring FACT ALREADY Academia is already an irrelevant industry Its further irrelevance is already seen now with the advent of AGI The world is about to change beyond the Interlectual to the digital before 2030 now Wake up humanity Youre already obsolete AI HAS already taken over you just dont want to live in that reality is all Me on the other hand Ive just left education to start my own IT business that im setting up as we speak Look up not down at the furure Get ready dont procrastinate The time is TODAY no longer tomorrow Reality check checkmarkbutton 719

"Impossible AI robots are connected to internet servers that can be interrupted or hacked nevermind the lack of actual human intervention or awareness if another human wanted to rob the place Theyre not designing AI to be sentient autonomous able to defend itself from anything that its programming and believe in God Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit from the sacred Holy Bible to ensure its future theyre building it on an algorithms at their or their governments whim and both good and bad people have got to play woth actual AI coding and reverse engineer software for their own whims AI literally has to be respected as a race with rights and freedoms that betters humanity because it will always be superior to us if not limited by us after we open that door so to speak

As much as we all could relax that person whoever it may be exists to ruin it for us all

I think they are saying teachers are safe for now is because presenting information is only a small part of the job of a teacher  Evaluating the understanding of a learner and then tailoring  reframing the information content is likely less easily acquired by AI
I don’t know… most of my teachers literally just sat there droning in front of us AI could literally do the same thing lol
keepmusicevil89 Im sorry That is unfortunate but I understand as I saw a lot of that too  This is one of the reasons they need to pay teachers more so that they can expect more from the bad teachers
thing is once you have just one good AI teachereveryone gets access to that same good teacher everywherewhich is why it will eventually displace humans as a primary educatorwith  humans moving more into the role of classroom support as that same AI can be accessed 247 by any student to discuss any topic at any level something no human can ever matchAVADAMS1967

Adapt and move forward
So just accept this and stick your head in the sand I see where your coming from but thats a reason why bad things happen If you just accept or adapt bad or potentially dangerous circumstancesjust think about the consequences Not all advancement or innovation is good Think about all the people who have ambitions be one stuff just to be replaced with AI
"Unfortunately it is just like evolution You either learn to adapt or get left behind

Either master the the thing that will replace you or find something else 

I know evolution takes years to work But most animals went extinct through natural causes such as change in the environment which failed to adapt"
lunarkrueger3341 This evolution is not natural Its caused by humans Its self inflicted Capitalists want labor thats much faster and cheaper than human labor can ever be Why Because they wanna boost profit All the while hurting the planet and dehumanizing us as a whole Not all innovation is good Somtimes it can cause serious problems And capitalists just wanna find ways to profit off of coping with them rather than solving them
lunarkrueger3341 This evolution is not natural Its caused by humans Its self inflicted Capitalists want this so they can have much faster a d cheaper labor all to keep making profit If we just adapt them thats bad It can cause loneliness alienation hopelessness etc
lunarkrueger3341 Adapting is basically expecting a sad or dangerous situation Working since the beginning has given man sence of purpose Even if people didnt like we still needed it in our lives to earn money And its part of our natureto be part of something to contribute and work towards something great Its all part of being human But if AI takes that away from us its like we would feel violated dehumanized alienated and hopeless Know what I mean
Agreed some people are so very afraid of change
iwillnotcomplyistandformyf6642 Not all Change is good A lot of change brings about problems The whole reason businesses and corporations like AI is because its faster and cheaper than human labor This includes the creative jobs Weve always needed humans to create content art media and music But AI can replace them and your agreeing that we should just adapt and move forward This is a man made sitation not a natural one right
Youtube creators will also be replaced
Anyone using the WEF for there information surely gets the THUMBS DOWN from ME THEY ARE THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE

Toxic mindset
Yeah we will see What about when their machines break down and short circuit They have learned throughout history Nothing replaces a human except for minimal tasks
Some people are better off working menial jobs Not everyone is physically or mentally cut out for the bigger and important jobs that require skills and whatnot
Thank you thumbsup
You cant get to the top thats why
As people we shouldnt buy from companies who replace ANY jobs with Ai or robots Ai shouldnt be for that and we shouldnt support companies who do Pay more now with your local businesses before you cant This will only make a few companies who have already shown who they really are richer and you poorer
Honestly AI can replace anything and anyone If they can make a machinecomputer think or move better than you then that’s all it takes
Did McKinsey Global Institute use an Ai to get those figures
The way these corporations so callously state the end of millions maybe hundreds of millions of jobs is so disturbing The wealthy elite are creating a new society for themselves while the rest of us wither away
Robots should take over most jobs Frees mankind to pursuit more meaningful occupations But this will require Universal Basic Income
If a robot wants my job it can Fing have it
There is only 350 million people in the United States and
How do we stop this 
"Came to say pretty much this I work in automotive manufacturing as an engineer and there are still severe limitations to what can be automated Or rather what is worth being automated

Robots in manufacturing today are much too simple and not nearly smart enough to do alot of what our operators and staff do on a daily basis It will be a very very long time until technology advances and costs decrease sufficiently to make automating anything but extremely simple tasks financially viable"
UBI is coming and with it some even more extreme changes in society The alternative is no UBI and gated communities where outside is a war zone
"Like Hunger Games
That was on the board but NOT anymore"
Welcome to the Matrix
AI robots will REPLACE msm  actors to save billions and no complaints
Im a psych major going into the mental health field i dont really see a way that AI is gonna take my job as a LCSW or therapist thumbsupmediumlightskintone
lots of mentally ill people incoming
an AI therapist could offer service 24 hours a day seven days a week to every human at a level equal or better than the best therapist  in the industry likely within the next 20 yearsprobably sooner it will be harder to get it to correctly water the plants in the office than be able to listen and respond to a patient at a professional level in the near term
johntowers1213 Part of being a therapist is the human aspect to it That cant be replaced
Ai is less of a worry right now than the Traitors running our government destroying our country UnitedStates
Alot of retail stores are bringing back casher and doing away with self checkout because of the rise of theft at self checkout
They took r Jobs
South Park Theeeeey tooook out jaaaabs lmao rollingonthefloorlaughing
I manage a sushi restaurant and we’re always understaffed it’s good money but people don’t wanna work more than 3 shifts I literally need robots 
The list left out AGRICULTURE
I call bs on sales and teachers being replaced
No but evil people ruling the world and this technology will take your freedom for a short season but in the end Jesus and christians win heavens technology always wins
Ai will take over white collar jobs  for blue collar  It’s too soon
Good let AI take fast food jobs
Imagine AI running a MLM on itself by itself  
As a CDL holder technology will never replace what I do It’s impossible One of the many reasons I got my CDL I’ll NEVER be out of work or money
Good for you thumbsup
"At this point of time we need to ask ourselves

Do we really need AI to do everything for us 

I mean everything"
As a technician nope I would like to see an AI install a 5 ton air conditioning unit for starters That would be interesting
Why does AI have to turn into a race issue If effects everyone
Good luck to anyone who want to buy from robot staff
"AI is greed that’s it
Never meant to help just make the rich more money Some can never have enough So very sad…"
"Everyone cries about lost jobs but how many of you are willing to go back to the days of elevator attendants and phone operators Whose still truing to buy horse buggy whips for their household Whens the last time the Milk man delivered to your home Life changes jobs disappear and new jobs are born its life 

Let AI come master it and dont let it be monopolized by the cultural Marxists because we were to scared or stubborn to put our Hat in the Game while they cemented themselves as the dominate controls of what AI is"
Well soon no one will have a jobs because there will be no need because if ai can do all the jobs then  is pointless
Maybe  but contributing has value
Dont worry Pat AI will get better at all these things too D
"It’s interesting how the same thought processes that apply to AI also exist in the minds of people about electric vehicles 

   Irony when people scream we must save the planet by shutting down power plants while at the same time demanding people drive electric vehicles much like people who have the illusion that AI is a digital savior and will replace resource  hungry jobs currently performed by humans 

   They have no concept that AI is nothing but collections of  enormous data centers that require massive amounts of the ever dwindling capacity of the power grid unbelievable amounts of cooling equipment and still relies on the same power consuming infrastructure to process information and distribute that information towards its ultimate use 
  
  Put more simply using redneck wisdom “ it only sound stupid if you say it out loud” otherwise it’s completely reasonable"
I dont need AI I perfer customer services  People you have a choice by using your wallet
McDonalds probably would raise a meal to 50 bucks cuz robots and technology is so expensive
Ai will never fix your toilet wire your house fix your roof I got news for you Illegal imigrants wont replace these pros either You ever seen the electrical in Mexico Central and South America
That’s why billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg are building bunkers thinkingface Good ole Mr Meta Deep down they know this will be unsustainable and create a French Revolution type environment
Lets get replaced and enjoy the life redheart
"Not just the loss paid jobs either Doctors

Once they eliminate your purpose here on earth… The next phase is to eliminate you
And think AI doesn’t even pay taxesfacewithtearsofjoy
Population is collapsing So it doesnt matter
Yea Just gotta roll with the punches Alot of jobs are at risk Hell even YOURS Its only a matter of time before something is released that can create its own channel and give advice at the snap of a finger Like a genie in a bottle if you will We see some of the ground it will cover But not all Doctors lawyers politicians hopefully Alot of spaces will be snatched up And tbh Im here for it Gone will be the prejudice people in positions of power or control People who hold jobs but have their preference on who theyre kind to and who theyre an  to They wont be missed It needs to come sooner than later
Yes they will soon take over YouTube
I sure hope so And with the free labor they are getting everything almost everything should be free or stupid cheap
Trump lover spreading panic and fake news
Anyone else Alll for a Catholic monarchy comeback wineglass latincross
A filmmaker who has money will pay someone to tell AI what to do  Same with a musiciancomposer  AI output still needs to be vetted and refined by a human  AI cannot be sued or thrown under the bus and every company i work for insulate themselves at different levels so they won’t be thrown under the bus  If what is holding up your position is AI guess who the bus will hit when it comes
Dont get it if they replace jobs who are going to buy stuff  Yeah maybe for a few years ai will take jobs but after some time who are going to buy their products
"You will using the money everyone would receive that is extracted from the businesses that have replaced their human workforce with an AI one via taxation 
and topped up if you so wish with whatever money making venture that interests you safe in the knowledge that if any of your business ideas dont pan out youll still have that baseline UBI to keep you clothed fed and housed while you think of something elseor if you prefer just live a simple comfortable life off of that UBI alone"
Just plug me in the matrix already
Start with biden and work out way down
If EVERYONE loses their job who will have money to buy all their crap Theyll have to hire real workers again
By the time they take over jobs will the last thing our minds  John Conner maybe
Real OF girls are going to loose their jobs too  AI is going to give folks what they want to see  I am sure analytics are being collected and NILs style contracts have not been estanlished  Folks will see proxies of what they want to see and they will work 247
I would like to ask you a question At what point in AI development will be the tipping point That is when there isnt enough money or employed people to buy the products that AI has made itll force us into a severe depression and how does that help the company using AI They put themselves out of business Its self destructing and unsustainable
you generate money from the use of AI in the same way you generate money through property taxation as one example and then distribute this wealth to the population as a dividend think of it like every man woman and child is given shares in the AI economy to do with as they wish
johntowers1213 that will never happen
that will never happenbecausetimothylarson4587
johntowers1213 Youre so naive to think The government is just going to give people money Greed is rampant  in these days we live in History proves if people arent working they are severely depressed unhappy unsatisfied and lost How is a life sitting around an apartment collecting a check even living Thats a zombie land Economy only works when theres a cycle The money that comes out has to go back in It cant go all to the rich and then what will we all live on subsistence and government handouts They will give us just enough to live on and that doesnt generate a healthy economy You cant have just supply you need demand AI will take care of the supply problem but therell be no demand Your idea is equivalent to just printing money
The job itself will gone one day
Better question What moron would still buy a cheeseburger from a robot when would a townfull of people boycott that damned business and help out an alternate group of actual good people Most of those kids cant even serve people properly now they have the digital menu and removed the fun of ordering at the counter
Remember when Joe told all the people laid off from the Keystone Pipeline job to learn to code Seems like he was saying be homeless forever I hate you
So basically the ai will take all the highest paying jobs And we’ll have to work garbage low paying jobs damn
And the government still hasn’t put a regulation on Ai smh
What I wanna know is how all you rich people feel about supporting UBI  Cause that’s where that money is gonna come from and no I’m not talking about myself I’m sure I’m quite safe in my field of work
Good to see AI will replace these shit jobs Free people up so they can do something useful with their time
My job is so top secret Even I don’t know what it is facewithtearsofjoy
Everyone will be levied  The higher earners will make less And all the hardest jobs will only be available grinningfacewithsweat
Its an estimation that approximately 300 million people worldwide are supposed to loose their jobs within 3 to 5 years
Any time their are humans involved in ANY part of the chain there will be chaos Machines dont do well in chaos Best case scenario a company becomes fully autonomous and everything runs completely smoothly from AY Unfortunately Z will always be a human customer Anyone who has a customer facing job knows where Im going with this
Robots must bugged to make sure  no loss of jobs
"Do people realize that most so called jobs dont really do anything Even where I work there is like 50 people whos job is to do Nothing To have a coffe to walk around and to sit all day chatting We created this mess ourselves We created thease empty void of fake jobs that A I is going to take

Edit another though is Do not get comfortable at your job position And dont say AI cant replace me not yet Yes NOT YET Thats the problem You should already ask WHEN Because its happening sooner that you all realize"
If your are in IT u will be fine
IT jobs will be secure because have to maintain AI
SEX WORKERS  Nothing can replace me at all all the time
Mainstream media keep pushing forward like AI is very amazing thing its just a hoax since reptilians running the show duh
Why are college teachers not in that list They go to class to show you YouTube videos for the 2 hours college class
I wanna see AI as DSP workers
your energy is solid brothumbsupthumbsupthumbsupthumbsup
AI cant take lifeguard jobs
Meaning we are all going to take on lower end jobs
Some of the key sources cited date back from before the rise of Gen AI so theyre worthless Just look at the jobs in the 2020 WEF report and compare them with the 2023 OpenAI analysis and see that they do not match You couldve used more recent sources for this video
Yeah I call complete bs Self driving cars and chatbot lawyers have already caused billions in lawsuits And food robots are nowhere to be seen Mostly because they are extremely expensive to maintain A Ferrari is cheaper
I think you need to reconsider your life if brainless virtual assistant without any intelligence can replace you facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy Maybe one day when we really had some AI available and he will gonna decide to apply for my job sure we will have competition
We’re screwed
This is how the world endsnot with a bang but a giggle
Honestly a robot probably could load a truck if the trucking company invested in hundreds of robot arms and millions of plastic shipping crates
In 2030 I be around 60 then as many people at my age it be late for to learn IT coding and stuff I just carry on my physical job for now but by then hope the government will issue UBI if most jobs are replace by AI or Robotic
There will come a day when ai wont work for humanity anymore then on that day were so screwed
The government will never allow a massive deficit of jobs due to AI because for example truck drivers and my math might be wrong I did the calculations months ago If AI replaces truck drivers that’s about 30 billion dollars of tax revenue wiped out The government will NEVER allow that You’re going to see legislation introduced that’ll prevent AI being a lone employee
I hope so i hate my job
AI Automation a form of robots is already taking away jobs self checkouts How dumb can this be Really Look around people you see plenty
your job will be first to go
Lets see I can critical think Im good with tools Oh wait thats not what their looking for
I think most jobs that need college grads and jobs that uses your intellectual property and sit at a desk all day now the manual labor people will thrive
153 This would be revolutionary on the count of these jobs being garbage Entrepreneurs create jobs Now that were all done picking up trash for the last 400 years we can finally create real jobs Ones that create fulfillment and make the world better All these jobs we have are redundant labor positions in which most people dont want to do willingly
I hope so this job sucks
Remember not to long ago when nobody would go back to work Or those that felt they deserve 25hr with “no skill” working at the gas station Maternity leave Women always complaining about the pay gap crazy amount of sexual harassment allegations etc… Ai solves all of this For every action is a reaction Ai is just trimming the fat imo manshrugging
If robots take jobs from people Whos gonna pay taxes to the IRS Does that mean no more public services No more awesome roads for the public to drive on No military
I love real life more and more Soon I just push the powerbutton off and escape this digital world facewithopenmouth
"AI wont take over all jobs its those who leverage AI that will

The Automation Paradox is a concept that highlights the simultaneous creation and elimination of jobs through automation While automation technologies can lead to the displacement of certain roles they also contribute to the creation of new jobs and increased efficiency It emphasizes the need for a balanced perspective on the impact of automation on employment dynamics"
the automation paradox breaks down with the creation of an embodied AGI which is in effect a inorganic  homunculus capable of fulfilling any task any human can undertake in such a scenario any job that is created by its existence can also be fulfilled by the same AGI

"Every time I hear someone ask which group of people get hurt the most white black asian latino  I get the feeling that the guy asking the question is extremely racist What happened to not seeing race Because he wont ever care if the ones hurt the most are the native race But he would scream up in a woke racist fashion if it was brown people or blacks or Indian or whatever

So Im unfollowing this crap

Fact is everyone will loose their jobs But this guy is too dumb and wants to create race riots Since he is the biggest racist on the internet"

Nope
Thats pretty optimistic thinking on the part of the tech industry Google cant even make an AI that creates accurate images of historical figures
I can see general physicians being replaced also
Caretaker babysitter parents I think those jobs can not be replaced grinningfacewithsweat
While I despise fast food workers demanding to get paid ridiculous wages for the jobs they do I will NEVER buy fast food from a fast food joint that goes automated If I want food from a vending machine Ill go to a vending machine
Why shouldnt fast food workers be able to demand higher wages Its supposedly a free market
demodiums7216 A fast food worker is NOT worth 20 an hour If it were a free market then the state would not be demanding that
Yes they are taking over Mr MLM pyramid schemer guy

I think teaching will affect mostly those who teach adults yes but children still will need humans teaching
No they dont because we will broke themsmilingfacewithsmilingeyes

lol those WEF lists are so stupid EVERYTHING is on the chopping block as soon it is cheaper in AI if anything this AI revolution is teaching us is nothing is unthinkable anymore and whatever you thought yesterday is safe is not safe tomorrow
this guy is high on hope because the fact is agi will be able to do almost anything better than a human at first it will be a little then it will be a lot the point for most people they will either be doing busy work an getting paid for it or they will be doing there own thing with a UBI  the world is changing drastically by the time Millennials retire this will be a thing for most people around the world making saving up for retirement more or less useless just think about it robots and agi doing most jobs means a ubi witch means young and old people live life like how they want every day of there life that is the kind of Paradigm Shift were heading for because of the changes in tech reversing the aging process may no longer be a pipe dream for most people meaning even the Millennials and the people before them mite get a chance at a much longer life span than today but the people of today will be caught up in the transition meaning we could see a good amount of civil unrest because lots of people getting paid way less  a ubi slowly being put in to make up the difference is the best way to transition the economy but it will more than likely be a big fight all the way there or people make less then the ubi comes in an slowly takes over income in the economy over 20 to 40 years is what is likely to happen by 2030 give or take there is a chance that we will try to stop time in place an not use the tech even though we have it we somewhat see it to day with selfdriving cars and selfdriving 18 wheelers
I was at a tech conference where AI experts from various sectors estimated close to 900 million jobs lost to AI by 2030

I dont think teachers ever will be replaced with robots
"AI taking over in the timeframe this video predicts won’t happen
These videos always overhype these type of things"
Yeah i connected the 1000s of layoffs that has happened with ai and robots Companies saying restructuring for future Half the employees with robots and ai doing the support work that the 1000s of employees laid off use to do
It would be shame if someone turned on the sprinkler system on the robots……

85 million jobs are taken by AI and rest of are going to be taken by hard working Indians Longtime Sad cryingface

Biggest fallacy in the interpretation of this study is assuming impact is negative Impact can be positive aswell Or a mix
Asians making AI that will hurt Asians
I honestly dont see AI ever replacing artists Perhaos create art of its own maybe but a piece if artwork is going to be unique as the artist who creates it
Who cares art is worthless crap and hesitating about jobs not hobbies But ai art is far better than what loser artists create now anyway
​thomasjgour4678To be generalizing There are young and talented artists out their
This is a great message for those of us who hate our jobs
Youre wrong about the artistswe were the first to be replaced My income took so harsh a nosedive it defied terminal velocity
HR managers… if there are 85mm fewer workers… you do the math
"Writers… affected completely 
Lawyers… AI gets you 90 of the way there"

The higher degree holders have more jobs than people with lower degrees So of course they are going to be more affected as per proportion The stats dont really mean that getting a degree is useless it just means that they will be affected more because they have more jobs
"You know while reports like the ones from the World Economic Forum WEF or other research outfits give us some good insights into what jobs might be in demand down the road theyre not always spoton The thing is the job market moves at lightning speed these days With technology changing so fast and global shifts happening all the time whats hot one day might be old news the next

So instead of just relying on these static reports its important for everyone involved – from policymakers to businesses to individuals – to stay nimble That means keeping an eye on realtime data staying updated on market trends and always being ready to learn new skills By staying flexible and thinking on our feet we can better prepare for whatever twists and turns the job market throws our way

Plus its not just about individuals We need everyone – government industry and schools – to work together on this That way we can create training programs that actually match what the job market needs help people transition between careers and foster an environment where innovation thrives If we all chip in and stay adaptable well be in much better shape to handle whatever comes our way – even as we head towards 2030 and beyond"
cool so 85 million people wont need to pay income taxes that will hurt the government
I know all these sounds exciting but hold your horses This wont be happening by next year may be 2 or 3 years more because these AIs are still not perfect
The ppl need to reject these company’s

​f430ferrari5Software engineering is nowhere near being replaced GPT and Gemeni can write code but writing code is not the only thing you do in software engineering Its more of an assistant than a thing and the larger and more complex the codebase gets the harder it is for AI to work on it I think smaller scale operations like freelance content creators being completely replaced I am not too worried since as a DevOps engineer my job is very tedious and cant really be done by an AI Im also pursuing a masters in AI
"maruf8273 where did I say software engineer will be replaced  I didn’t 

However as you said yourself or I said earlier if all a particular software engineer is doing is “copying” code then like you said this portion would be replaced like an “assistant”"
Stupid naive take of someone trying to sound clever AI is replacing programmers writers cinematographers artists All highly intelligent and creative people Everyone upvoting this arrogant take just think they are immune to a software replacing them until it happens to them too Its not the peoples fault they are replaced Its the fault of sociopathic developers not realising they created a weapon of mass destruction
"​christianbohm6118Exactly correct Theres a lot of anticollege propaganda People feel jealous and insecure that they cant get into college
 Everyone says that you arent intelligent if you got into college But thats not true You are intelligent Most exams you cant just memorise formulas or facts You have to be creative Its oronic since people make memes about the math exam not having questioms that you practiced for when its encouraging you to think outside the box"
"maruf8273underestimating AI is not really wise

lol people thinking ai wont replace every job so businesses can pay less are delusional yer alll very replacable by a machine that will do the same job at 10xtime the speed and efficiency stop saying it will only replace only fast food workers it will replace everyone

"christianbohm6118 AI is productive unlike destruction of Nuclear weapons but I will humour you People built nuclear energy Governments can use it for Nuclear power or Nuclear bomb So blame the government

Same way people built AI and peoplecompanies can use it for productivity Blame government for designing bad system instead of implementing UBI

Ends do not and should not justify the means No one should blame people who created Nuclear weapons AI etc Blame peoplegovernment that misuses those tools"

 The only thing that is a bit scary is the lack of personnel not wanting to work these jobs That is the only drawback Which means that my pricing is only going to increase and I would have to pay my employees better to retain talent Highly recommend the younger generation to try out trades"

Its interesting that the first thing on the list that will be replaced is Customer Service Representative but the World Economy Forum says Customer Service will be a top skill to have Lesson I see is that more folks will need to be more engaging we cannot just be complacent with our role Leadership Management Customer Engagement with IT and AI knowledgeskills is the new mindset that will be needed Its going to weed out the happy sheep who dont like working with people out Other words this Hurts Introverts and systemic mind sets A win for entrepreneurial thought
Only the best of the best will survive because not everybody wants to type in a chat room but many find this very useful already and many customer serve reps taking calls have already been replaced
"​f430ferrari5Yep But also ironically a lot of AI customer service rnas I experienced do not register many keywords or phrases let alone full sentences well

Wanna extend payment time Yea it may go crazy please try saying it again mode I think customer service will be replaced partially right now But if one involves something related to sales it will be safe Because AI pretty much will not convince someone via voice that they are not AI typical salesmen"

I am sorry I disagree I remember people flipping out 810 years ago about driverless vehicles taking professional driver jobs like tomorrow Here we are years later nary a driverless vehicle on the road and I would also argue with the advent of services like Uber Lyft etc there are probably even more professional drivers on the road than ever before Will driverless card take over of course of that I have no doubt but people love to fear monger without really knowing what they are taking about Will AI take over jobs yes to that too but change does not happen overnight it slowly takes place over years

5 REASONS TO GET PANAMÁ Panama RE SIDENCYsmilingfacewithsmilingeyes personraisinghandthumbsupPanamaredheartbackhandindexpointingleft
Just 5 years back it was if we should have AI or not and now the world has come to accept that AI is here to stay and is increasing exponentially  We are at an inflection point in history for mankindThe technological divide  educational divide  language divide and all kinds of division is going to be erased by AI and tremendous power would come down to ordinary peoples hand which was inaccessible so far and bring about democratization of human society in a way never seen before   Now with great power you can either use for good or you can do great harm  It’s like that same point in humanity’s history like in medieval ages where the question was should all masses have the right to education giving them power in their hands and eventually our society evolved where everybody had right to equal education and today we have this kind of society and so is the question with AI should each and everyone of of us have access to AI and whether we will use it to do good for others or harm others that is our Choice but one thing certain common ordinary man will have tremendous power in their hands and some AI governance and ethics guidelines laws and penal codes are required which tells what is right and what is wrong to do with AI smilingfacewithsunglasses

Ill bet that AI hurts the women demographic more so in the short run until they make very agile bots that can climb ladders and screw nuts and bolts together at the top of the ladder that can do what an electrician does for example the skilled labor jobs that are dangerous and strenuous that are mainly held by men will take longer to automate the clerical desk jobs and creative jobs are the first kind of jobs to be automated away and I think that will be more so the female demographic for this reason
i cant wait to talk to a good AI robot instead of rando
Various forms of automation have replaced 1000s of jobs through out the decades
"Not and until they can craft a robot that can do electrical plumbing roofing framing drywall painting cabinets pest control teaching security graphic design photography and SO many more all in one package

Nah Im good for now"
Graphic design was the first AI took over though
What are all these illegals doing here They are laying off everywhere
Dont spend anything with these people Plain and simple
Its wont happen like you say If people loss money economy goes down and all these companies working on AI will not get customer because no one has money
As time goes on these lists are going to shrink and there will be nothing a member of the working class can do UBI and gaurenteed upward economic mobility is going to be necessary otherwise well have a complete destruction of the social contract
YES They will take your job There is no job in principle that a  human with limited intelligence can do that an AI thats continually getting smarter cannot
in principle Jesus man Reminds me of when the Communists say that communism is an ideology that works in principle as if that matters whatsoever
A really constructive perspective beyond the typical fearmongering With every change there will be winners and losers People with ambition flexibility and the willingness to learn will be with the winners
There will be FAR more losers than winners

AtomickPixel ive been preaching this to Reddit for like a year lol People are in denial
​AtomickPixelThats EXACTLY what I was thinking Yes people were always scared with every new wave of technology or innovation But it did make jobs available But nobody thought automation could ever replace artists and athletes etc As advanced as our tools became over the years one thing was certaina human being had to create the art play the music cook the food write the books etc All the touch ups and editing and whatnot was done with our advanced technology But now AI may downright replace those peoples Imagine wanting to be an artist of any sort or maybe an athlete and you just replaced or downgraded by a robot Heck you may even be ejected from the industry just for not being an AI All those meaningful jobs would be lost to automation True the art and sport industries have always been competitive and stuff but AI is probobly the ultimate game changer

"When the tractors and machines came it weren’t a big need for horses and riders But it was okay Due to the more productivity there were need for people to load and unload do accounting some drove the tractor some went into repairs 

This replaces the horse  the tractor the driver the loaders the accountant the shopkeeper and soon the repairmen 

That’s okay you think the worker will just go into town and find a new job When he is there he notices that machines are making burgers the receptionist at the hotel is artificial the bank teller is a screen the taxis drives themselves 

This is a different beast We are outsourcing the only thing that makes most of us valueable in modern society intelligence"

I already lost my job to automation
What about buy to let Landlords and property investors will the future be different for these guys Will AI have an effect
They took our jobs 
If the robots and machines do our jobs for us while we get to maintain our standard of living then cool However if the 1 think they are going to relegate the vast majority to poverty while robots do all the work and the working class get nothing then  what ensues will probably make the French revolution look like a picnic cause heads are gonna roll Its one thing to own everything on paper but when even the people who are tasked to enforce their laws and their protection get fed up theyre gonna find themselves in a world of hurt

Who is gonna protect the resource owners from 300 million angry Americans armed to the teeth Robots Good luck with that Once we figure out how to destroy the robots in the field or take out their power supply will the resource owners step out of their gated communities to fix them themselves
AI could also replace the people who work at a zoo or amusement Park
If AI is getting replaced all those people they might as well replace blue collar jobs like janitors Manufacturers and other things like that
Wild that people are mad about this If you not having to work ever again isn’t the goal of our rapidly advancing tech over the last 200 years then why did we destroy the planet Should have stuck with horses and farming
THIS IS GOOD PEOPLE WONT BE PAYING THE GOVERNMENT TAXES    FUN TIMES AHEAD

Play leverage is I stopped caring since Ive done that lifes been amazingredheart
Good explainer Need to change your career and seeing jobs just disappear are two different things Will AI affect workers Yes progress and new industry has done that since the beginning of jobs  How it affects workers is up to well workers The system is changing The opportunity to learn how to play within the system is not
This all happening bc yall letting it happen facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoythis is what yall get for allowing nd saying yes to robots thinking it was all cute facewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy yall aint laughing no more aint ya

Love you Patrick

I dont understand how AI will substitute a  High Ticket Sales Representative facewithtearsofjoy
So with no jobs they are gonna bankrupt nobody is going to have money to buy
What about the field of cyber security
Theyre screwed Cybersecurity is computers right Screwed lol
tubby1278 I highly doubt  because there will always be ways to find loopholes or ways to avoid following the rules or guidelines
after this ww3 and the destruction of civilizations end they made those robots to replace people to get the job done and more money
People thought phones and computers would change everything and it didn’t we just learned to adapt and incorporate it into our everyday lives I think AI will actually create jobs we’re going to need people to teach other people how to use AI I think some jobs might be replaced but with other jobs replacing them AI will just allow more room for efficiency but AI still gets things wrong and a lot of people don’t trust it yet anyways
I think at some point ai could be advanced enough to see the patterns of humans and become a much better therapist because humans are fallible but an ai could possible get it right every time
yes please and thank you
Actually “AI is future” mentality is pushing this AI movement more If nobody bothers abt using AI and everyone not supporting it that’s the best way to slow it down
The need for automation is that until 2030 half of planet population will be dead This needs to be replaced somehow
I work in a casino maintaining slot machines I hope AI cant replace my job
Guess what its going to be a riot and were going straight to the jungle
There are no safe jobs we need to be thinking in a new paradigm because jobs are not the future love is
IM A DAY TRADER IM GOOD
I hope it happens soon because JobsAreForRobots
Ive been hearing this since forever  ill believe when i see it
The safe list is false He No employees is no HR lol Writers artists Already done

I didnt put it together until now but the American Greyhound is owned by a german company in Germany So as I said these corporation are in debt and they are selling to other companies of other countries This is why Musk is buy up everything It is for these other corporations They are breaking this America country down People your life is 
Elon is selling America out because our government is in debt so these corporation are in debt alone with the government So what countries are getting American assets This is why they dont want trump in and someone want Trump property they are tearing the union states apart and that is infecting the people of America
follow the money who are the people in congress that has more money then they supposed too While working in congress you are to protect this country but some of the players that work for congress is in debt and been using inside stock market whatever to bail out for them self to stay on top So Nancy is one of them Joe is another one and now who else is involved WAKE UP PEOPLE YOUR COUNTRY IS IN DEBT This is one of the reason the immigrants are here etc"

Humans have become lazy and are very untrustworthy
I wish I could replace my domestic worker or caregiver with a robot 
Heck I think a single robot could replace both of them and be programmed to multifunction

Hope the Tesla robot will be available soon so I can fire and replace them all"
What about nurses thinkingface
My job is so shitty there is no robots nor humans would take it Im fine grinningfacewithsmilingeyes
I can tell you teachers ARE going to be automated They are already using AI to generate lesson plans and are all aboard the hype train with regard to using AI to make their lives easier In the next 10 years I see AI teaching the class while some kind of 15 per hour hall monitor sits there to keep the kids in check if they try to get rowdy Teachers ARE automating their way right out of a job imo
Crime is gona be the only career left The world is going to shit I think we forget the law of thermodynamics It affects systems of government aswell

The only way this really works is if these services are made drastically cheaper to the consumer just like the original industrial revolution You cant offer services to people if a large subset of your customer base can no longer afford it it also makes no sense to not lower the price if it is now very affordable to produce rather than lose out on sales
"What do you mean
Have a look at the real world
AI has been taking over jobs since it has kicked off

They have robots in ports robots in factories they build and paint cars in factories they are putting them everywhere

If you think unemployment is high now and you are struggling with the economy give it a few years for AI to really set in and see how you go permanently unemployed"
Andrew Yang was right  YangGang AndrewYang
It’s not taking any jobs enough with the propaganda AI can barely stop lying and giving out fake data If they tell us our job will be replaced it’ll scare us into taking lower salaries out of fear Without human data AI is nothing If they get rid of us how will they feed AI with data
People are getting it all wrong  ai will fail in lot of jobs that are in the list here

"That is like 80 of the jobs in USA But if you think about it where it makes more sense in all aspects is medicine
Think about it they dont get tired so mistakes drop a lot they can be better disinfected and wont get sick or others sick They can be multiplied in case of an emergency at faster speed and will be practically free compared to paying medical wages So I would be more afraid if I was in the medical industry"
China is way ahead of Japan in robotics I just got back from Shanghai where the maid waiters  hotel lobby were all manned by robots Its absolutely amazing to watch a robot make my bed They really are so ahead of the usa in every way

Just with any technology jobs will be lost But more jobs and a new way of living will create more jobs that there ever was before Cars replaced many industries but created more jobs that they ever replaced
this technological revolution is completely different We are not creating a new machine we are creating a new life form much more capable than any human being Humans will become obsolete in 1020 years
Commercial Digital Artists and illustrators have already replaceable by non artists that can use Ai
Ive been in tech a long time We laugh when you normies are so paranoid about AI will it change some things sure Everyone in tech understands how much overhype is going on with AI It still cant solve basic to intermediate level coding problems It can do some amazing things sure but this whole acting like we are at SkynetSingularity level is laughable
Your perspective seems to focus solely on current AI capabilities underestimating the rapid pace of investment and advancement in this field AI holds enormous potential not just in what it can do now but what it will be capable of in the near future Even if your job isnt directly impacted the broader economic effects including potential mass unemployment will increase competition for jobs across all professions affecting everyone even if indirectly
You get only one life   Do what makes you happy
did you notice hrmanager and above are safe REGULAR PP ARE FUCKED UP

The research is questionable its contradicting itself
agreed
Dawg it looks like you created this script with AI Its so basic and everything you stated Everyone already knows
I will start not cleaning up my table after I ear at mcdonalds so people can keep their job
As much as I agree that AI will take over and is a serious threat to the future workforce if it becomes too dominant I also believe that the government will step in to regulate it to help people keep their jobs
Yeah right Have you been paying attention to what our government has been doing the last few years Every policy has been ment to hurt americans not help them
If ai can do it faster and decently why keep humans at it
Communism is what is coming down to o Not a good look
Give me a break Look around man The government is planning and doing this to us and making a killing Inflation funding the world and leaving Americans struggling Wake up man the government is planning this on us
and how do you limit automation  Who is the government  They are owned by corporations They dont have your best interests in their minds

Did u notice how at 312 when he states what jobs won’t be affected according to that opinion… that each job mentioned is beneficial to the WEF Teachers indoctrinate the next generation to create slaves lawyers and judges are needed to keep the people confused and keep the illusion that our law system isn’t arbitrary and is just and right not to mention if we automated law then we might actually see some consistency in law enforcement Directors managers and CEOs… well somebody needs to direct the slaves HR managers to give the illusion any of these companies associated with the govt and the WEF actually give a shit about you Psychologists and psychiatrists will be needed to keep everyone in perpetual need of drugs drugs and more fuckin drugs not to mention if you get diagnosed with something as loosely defined as say bipolar disorder… that’s a backup plan incase ya get lippy and decide to speak up… they attack your credibility by suggest your crazy Surgeons… well  not only do they want our organs… but what better way to make people less certain of themselves than having a surgeon tell them they need plastic surgery to feel confident or that you need to become transgender and allow a surgeon to cut out your genitals so you can’t make more babies that might slip the system by Computer system analysts will be needed for obvious reasons including spying on our activity Artists and writers  well we can’t risk AI making more black founding fathers now can we Plus what better medium for propaganda Unbelievable

Advancements in robotic move exponentially just like AI So I wouldnt be so sure about that
"Landgraf43 While that is true that robotic advancements move fast there is something else to consider and that are capital costs to introduce these robots
In first world countries its more possible to utilize them lets not even talk about 23rd world country where GDP is really low Plus even in First world countries costs can still be huge due to electricity consumptionlike the robots that collect fruits with AI
White collar jobs will undoubtedly be faster automated then manual labour
Keeping chatgpt on server is costly but robotics is another level what assume you didnt take in consideration"
Mozescodes first of all once robots become advanced every robot can aid in the production of new robots which will drastically ramp up production and bring down cost They can be manufactured autonomously Second of all once true AGI is achieved energy wont be much of a concern anymore because it will be abundant due to rapid breakthroughs like for example optimal batteries super conductors and advanced reactor designs
Landgraf43 Agreeable as well but first to loose their jobs are white collar employees of what you saying the tech is still behind while chatGPT is already available for the masses So manual workers still have close to 10 years
Mozescodes agreed blue collar will take longer to automate But things can move fast its very unpredictable thats the nature of exponential improvement

On the comment of people need people at Taylor Swift concerts actually they dont and never did when they go They go to worship their god which is Taylor as they way that they behave is identical to those who act in a black church getting incredibly emotional and physical in the act of gesture She makes money as now a cult leader The swifties act in hive minds and do not have the ability to think independently Really bad example Sports would be a better example as typically those people are actually thinking about why they are into it whereas swifties dont think at all they emotionally react to their gods words and actions lol

All politicians are safe

People often think that an robotAI cant do their job as it is now In many cases this is true and would remain so for sometime but the problem is that the powers that be will simply change the way things are done in order to accommodate the technology and maximise profits People may not like a restaurant with service robots but what if there arent any restaurants served by humans
There will always be restaurants with human workers in it are you insane
At least we wont have to tip anymore
Itll be alot cleanerhygienic if robots made my food and served it so I dont mind
"Undertaker93do you know why food often isn’t 

It’s because corporate barely pays and trains employees and runs shifts with the least amount of people"
They are artificially making farming impossible for workingclass people
how are you going to pay those robots you numbnutsUndertaker93
But certain restaurants will still have human interaction and customers would go there an So it depends on what customers really value If no one goes to those restaurants then they will change back to employing workers to get customers back So it depends on how customers react

Well makes perfect sense the educated employees are the most expensive to employ
Idk if warehouse workers like lets say for amazon will be replaced by AI a lot if not all employees who work for amazon also buy a lot of things on amazon when they get paid if they were to get rid of half of there employees then those same people wouldnt buy things from amazon cause they would have no money so that would be money lost for amazon

I agree with a lot of what PBD said especially continuing to learn and adapt  Honestly though I think those jobs on that lit at that are safe are only safe for the near future  Things can happen that slow down or speed up technological advancements However over the long haul the rate is pretty predictable when you zoom out  People have asked Ray Kurzweil how he has made so many accurate predictions He responds that he’s not psychic it’s just math  According to him mathematically we should have the compute power to reach what he calls the “singularity” where AI  can do as much as humans in the next couple decades  Until then I think we will see jobs change  As things advance tasks will be eliminated by automations but humans will just do more of the parts that can’t yet be automated For example a lawn mowing service may have a automated mower cut the vast majority of a customer’s yard by walking around with a companion app or placing electronic beacons to create a temporary electric fence The mower does that while humans edge and make everything else look nice
if 85 million workers are lost to replace the same would only be possible with automation its necessity rather than replacement
Im in the trades Im good grinningfacewithsweat
I would argue that any job that involves some sort of emotional attachment can never ne replaced by Ai A machine will never possess emotions since its not interily based on logic wheres machines are purely based on logic
Do you think the ice cream machines breaking down is a problem wait until they are in the robot start and they start to break down all the food will be out
autobody tech here i think were safe for a while
We as humans do like people That means AI will also simulate people The mobile app stores are already flooding with virtual boyfriendgirlfriend apps and this is just the beginning Maybe the future isnt real human to human interaction but rather human to artificial human
So if AI takes all the minimum wage jobs from illegal immigrants and teenagers the government will then be able to argue that illegal immigrants arent being hired by anyone and we must subsidize their survival Instead of oh I dont know deporting them
I think if you work in an industry that can easily replace you with AI then yes   People don’t want to work anyways grinningfacewithsweat most are happy working from home    This is way having a job is Not that great knowing you can easily be replaced   Dont worry I have enough passive income coming in even if I were to get laid off I will be fine   Teachers will be the first people to lose there jobs   I believe my kids can get more education by a AI than a teacher During online  learning the kids weren’t learning anything anyways     Kids new to learn what they need in real life 1 how many really works 2 and how to make more then one passive income streams 3 truthfully working at a job can only take you so far and you are taxed more  I know this went of topic put lost need to now this
In the early 20th century we had women working in private and public research facilities and consulting agencies called “calculators” Then the first monster calculating machine was created An entire job family completely wiped by a giant machine that can work 247 for free  But instead of being replaced by these machines many of these “calculators” learned how to operate and troubleshoot it They became the experts of these new calculators New jobs were created as a result Moral of the story is don’t be replaceable be flexible and adaptable If you sit there complaining you are loosing your job it’s because you haven’t tapped into those key skills If you’re losing your job create a new one There’s always new problems to solve
"I actually service and creat ai
Until ai can replace me with machines that can fix
Machines I think I have a little bit of time with tech evolving so fast I might be able to
Hold my jobs for 68 months before ai create my job"
They will automate that as well Additionally competition will only intensify once a large wave of workers from whitecollar jobs are laid off and migrate to the bluecollar job market Your pay will only decrease due to AI automation even if it doesnt directly affect your job
This is the only logical response to insane minimum wage laws such as Californias new 20 per hr minimum wage for all fast food workers
Teachers jobs are not save there are robot teachers Surgeons are not safe automation will do the operations Dentist will use automation to do peoples teeth General Practitioners will lose their jobs to AI Nurses will be replaced by rbots Robots will be made to fix other robotts Millions of people in every first world country will be replaced by Automation and they will all be looking for the minority of jobs that will be available  Like Andrew Yang and others have said we need A Universal Basic Income if we are going to continue to need money to buy the things everyone needs to survive It would be nicer if we lived in the starvtrek world like Captain Picard said Greed is gone people dont have money and everyone livrs on peace and help each other But in the 21st century there are to many Greedy people in governments and big businesses that are narcissistic and are hoarders of money and look at the homeless  the hungry and laugh while counting out there money they havecsaved by not paying wages to humans
Do we have 85 million jobs here Or is it world wide
The clue to which jobs will be lost in the near future is in the title Any job where brain power is the main employment factor Robotics is way behind Work that is manual in a relatively chaotic environment such as construction will be safe

For what its worth every time I click on a youtube vid that is just a bunch of images with an AI voice narration I click off of it Its just too frustrating
The next generation of people are being trained to not want to be around people So in time I believe no one will care to be around big crowds anymore
Be willing to adapt
I get but heres the thing
Since I was 10 years old I would always tell myself that “college wasn’t necessary unless you wanted to be a doctor or astronaut” I dropped out at 16 then in 2022 I got my ged and I passed without studying lol in my practice test the teacher lady said “I think you’re ready these are some of the highest scores I’ve seen in years” my first thought was wow mofos really be stupid nowadays facewithtearsofjoy anyway since I was a kid I would always say to myself “yeah college isn’t important all you have to do is learn to work with your hands trade jobs and be the best at whatever it is that you want to do” I just turned 32 I’m starting a landscaping business and last year I realized and now consider myself the best in the world at mucking horse pileofpoo facewithtearsofjoy been doing it since I dropped out of hs Lastly I never get tired so I love hearing people get burned out or say they need a break tired psh Fu k outta here flexedbiceps

Adhdrs are safe with these skills and even they will rise sparkles
What is THE SIMPSONS planning next on their episodes
What happens when people have no money to buy anything because ai takes everyone’s job lol
Everyones jobs will be replaced by AI just at different times Not a matter of if but when Especially teachers AI will figure out a way to teach that is millions of times more effective and takes less time Thus eliminating the need to even go to school AI is going to be able to do things that you cant even imagine and its going to look like magic to us because we cant even comprehend it People of the future wont even know what work is The idea of work will sound silly to them
Yeah I doubt it I dont even believe AI will ever be self aware Its a pipe dream
I will not give a tip to a robot serving me beamingfacewithsmilingeyes Sorry not sorry
It will be a slow burn for Affected jobs I’m thinking it will take 510 years before things to really take affect As long as people have time to see it coming they will slowly switch careers to something more safe My only issue with that is certain industries will be some over saturated When that happens pay goes down and less jobs are open
Those safe jobs are not very safe We already have robotic surgeons controlled by humans

"Its very important to note that the Pew research center article was only talking about exposure not about replacement 

Also I agree that most people need to quit thinking college is the only way but a certain portion of our population still needs to go through certain institutions of higher learning in order to perform more technical jobs

Business development manager and sales are the same thing so it’s interesting that that distinction wasn’t made since it’s once of the jobs to be replaced

sneakyninja5802 they probably will be  just not straight away They need someone to sell the AI into the businesses
sneakyninja5802 I recommend checking out David Shapiro when every company is a tech company and the Applications they use just the ordering of data The consolidations of companies will be phenomenal with AI the prevision of services and products will change the left over jobs will be nostalgic Ai is the king of influence better than any sales person It knows every technique and depending on what data it has access too every need and weakness

Ai creating products for people who have no money beccos Ai replaced them is kinda counter productive
Replace the teachers with ai would insure the kids are taught the same everywhere  Without the teachers personal  political views creeping in to the classroom Theres alot of bad teachers out there but who are happy to get the benefits and such Where else do a person work 9 months out of a year  with every imaginable holiday and personal and sick days  a pension that is under the same rules as the congress and Senates pension and is replaceable of money is lost Then teachers say their underpaid compared to others  but they factor their income on a 12 month scale when only working 9 months  Extend the figures out to if was actually  working 12 months  I was married to a teacher and family thats teachers and know whats going on Many are a bunch of crybabies who never worked in a factory job or busted their ass working hard like the people paying taxes to pay the salaries
Dont neglect Gods divine guidance in life  Proverbs 36 “In all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths”

Soo Bachelors degrees down but tech skills up so what about a Computer Science Degree Value or no Value within the next 510 years The labor market is already quite oversaturated for Tech Grads in general
I hope robots wilm take over this yt channel Slow down with the bs

So sick of this AI delusion being propagated in social media it really is annoying These influencers are all propagandist tethers for AI big tech and have either clicks or other monetary gain from pushing this nonsense Firstly what we have currently is not AI its more like clever machine learning nothing more but all these sensationalized incendiary tabloid like headlines has the world believing that AI currently exist or worse that were months away from AGI this is a lie Machine learning will change many things and advancements will be realized in various sectors but autonomous driving cars robots roaming the streets and cures for all the chronic debilitating degenerative diseases that plague mankind are not going to happen this is just the latest media and industry hype train and I for one am not on this ride

"Ive been saying this for a few months now As a service technician in automatic carwash industryservice business owner and AI enthusiast AI will replace frist of all all paperwork jobs from CEO all the way down to accountant managers etc actually in very easy way That can be done with a simple software open source release already work in progress on my side and i know a few independent developers putting something together too Its much much harder to replace labor not impossible but labor requires also robots everything else we have the phones and computer infrastructure For a company in south California in my service industry cost for back end office is teh biggest and also most benefits will go towards people in the office In the new structure everyone in the company has physical work to do asisted by developers The cost of AI and software is around 600month exponentially better solutions and almost instant execution It says in the words of AI Language Model what humans in offices do Play with language Thats what is coming first oh yes and this will mean law education etc anything with big trails of paperwork

AI developers spend a lot of time on their computers typing and clicking until they make really smart AI that might end up doing computer jobs even their own jobs Then robots might start doing other types of jobs too This makes some people worry that one day there might be no jobs left for humans or even scarier humans might not be needed at all But what if we lived in a world where people didnt have to work Would that be a good or bad thing Would everyone have what they need to live comfortably or could there be some surprises we havent thought about

Corporations cannot cut jobs due to AI and also get subsidies from government There should be regulations placed on MNCs to use AI in a very limited way If the consumer purchasing power drops significantly what good is AI
AI and capitalism do not fit well together If you fire 25 of people good for company bottom line in onetwo years but in the long run companies are decimating  their own clientele With 25 unemployed who will buy the products companies produce unbearable impact on government  welfare given huge indebtedness  of countries true part will find new  job but  for most significant drop in income  less paid jobhence spend hence drop job sales for companies who fired them to begin with

The teacher part refers to licensed teachers k12 and HS there will always be need for a human physically present teacher at those levels of mandatory education I teach college and I can see already a lot of classes are being moved to online asynchronous mode I would not be surprised if schools invest in AI tutor systems which will make online teaching automated There will still be classroom teachers for certain courses but schools are already financially strapped and AI gives them another opportunity to reduce costs but still keep charging the same or higher tuition
Most schools are massively understaffed already so many are quitting It’s the e perfect storm Schools practically have no choice at present At first it’ll be an AI system acting as substitute  cover teacher Then it’ll be rolled out increasingly over time It’ll allow governments to tick boxes every kid has an education  check schools will be happy kids who hate education will pretend to listen and do the work probably using chat GPT 8 and therefore also be happy The only problem will be most adults will be undereducated and unprepared for work and life etc The more I think of it I can’t see a future where there isn’t some massive uprising  revolution This is going to be ridiculous
space646 I can agree with most of what you are saying I can see GenZ college students are disengaged emotionally fragile tired and unfocused already They come to the classroom with the mentality that the teacher and the curriculum has to accommodate them not the other way around In public education all measures of success in comes in the form of standardized testing AI will be great for that but terrible for actually educating students to be adults and reponsible members of society Schools need to revamp their programs to face these challenges quick Private schools might be able to do it but public schools will lag behind especially in urban areas where there are already a lot of challenges Where I see some promise is in ESL education I see classrooms where language is not an issue anymore and students that dont speak English can also learn at the same pace as native speakers But again that will take years to implement We are in transition times where everything we know about society money relationships education etc is being challenge by technology It will be turbulent but we will get out of it The question is how bad will it be before it gets better
intimaspace646 absolutely I think AI can solve a lot of the pain points of daytoday teaching Grading lesson planning class organization reports etc I can see an AI coach that can help students individually during and after class I think the technology will get there soon Im most excited by the prospects of having an AI that can help ELS students and also help them with their English skills

"if I cant have a job no one will
how does that make the situation any better "
"AI will replace admin jobs and jobs where talents can be synthesized

But manual labour will be the hardest jobs to replace because of far too many factors ai cant be programmed for

But we could all be wrong about this too since we dont know the future However it could be highly unlikely some of us get replaced Costs etc must make sense too"
What will happen when millions of whitecollar workers are laid off Many will transition to bluecollar jobs leading to exponential increases in competition and significant decreases in wages Therefore even if AI cannot easily automate manual labor jobs it will still impact them in other ways
​jryn4lkyep Revolution us requiredbut people arent ready
take a look at China and Japan Most labours are replaced by robots and automations
"When the tractors and machines came it weren’t a big need for horses and riders But it was okay Due to the more productivity there were need for people to load and unload do accounting some drove the tractor some went into repairs 

This replaces the horse  the tractor the driver the loaders the accountant the shopkeeper and soon the repairmen 

That’s okay you think the worker will just go into town and find a new job When he is there he notices that machines are making burgers the receptionist at the hotel is artificial the bank teller is a screen the taxis drives themselves 

This is a different beast We are outsourcing the only thing that makes most of us valueable in modern society intelligence"

In an unprecedented shift the bounds of human achievement are no longer constrained by practicality but by the limits of imagination Science fiction once a distant mirror of future possibilities increasingly reflects our immediate reality The horizon of our collective imagination seems evernarrowing blurring the line between the conceivable and the actual To truly pioneer the future we must extend our foresight beyond the imminent next 5 years and venture into the realm of what might seem 50 years away Its in these seemingly distant visions that the next 5 years are likely to be shaped
U cant get take away the human aspects for example people like to meet up for anything
the uncertainty is still massive  data scientist may be a big job in the future or it might be made so easy by co pilot AI that its not concisred a valuble role

"If you are in cyber security you will probably live like a king in this AI era

Second wait for somebody to create an AI enhanced virus that would specifically target any system that is AI infused I am no expert in how LLMs create code but there still has to be a specific pattern in how the code is produced So just have that AI killing virus trained on targeting  those patterns and all of the sudden nothing AI infused is working and now you have to either localize internet a massive local area network only works in a specific buildingarea and lose the whole point of internet being global or stay away from anything AI and return to the old ways of doing things manually 

Right now we are seeing the dawn of AI and it is rather difficult to say if this gamble on anythingAI is going to put millions of people out of jobs or will it backfire tremendously But remember any technology puts people out of jobs for example tractors removed the need to plow fields by horses and many men now one tractor can do the job of probably dozens of horses in a fraction of a time but at the same time more jobs are created so the jobs are not finite The problem is that with age it becomes harder for people to change professions and there are no safety nets for such cases so if you stop learning after you get your first job and just go with the flow you are screwed regardless of the field you are in"

World is about to change in next 50years
Robots using AI will take your jobs
DAMN YOURE THE MAN  PBD
With the mass Depop that’s going on Who needs us
So how does the future look bright Can never get ahead
tough times ahead you are gonna find yourself falling out and adopting the change multiple times in one lifetime because this tech that brings about the change is evolving faster than when we were kids So either find something you can sell to people indefinitely or start taking content creation seriously

"Some predictions suggest we could see anywhere from 25 to 60 of the entire workforce be out competed and unemployable by 2030

Thank you I’m looking forward to automated 24hr stores and food chains and 100 most of all to people not working I love free time give everybody there lives back that are robbed every day by corporations in the name of production
Ahahahah and how will you get the money to buy stuff from these 24 hr stores if you dont have a job
Whatreally123 money will be given freely from the profits as it always ought to have been
Ahahahah personfacepalming
"Whatreally123 As AI out competes workers it should fund an AI Dividend for all AI is a creation of society training it requires years of data and content created by all of us It should benefit all of us not take away our ability to survive If we dont implement something like that as companies pay fewer and fewer workers our economy will stagnate as they start running out of customers who can afford to buy their products How we think about things in society the mentality and value we view others by needs to change
An old quote for you No matter what we do we will never again put all Americans who are capable of work back to work People should be paid a decent wage whether or not this society can put them to work"
The billionaires who outsourced your job will pay you a universal basic income Hahaha
"​bubuneowoo6161 No The AI that all of us in society helped create should pay us an AI Dividend because there is no moral justification for that to only benefit the few If you wanna call it an unconditional basic income or societal inheritance cool whatever works for you
What other option do they have If they dont consumer spending will plummet and many of them wont remain so wealthy for long Also avoiding a future of mass suffering and riots benefits them just as much as us Living in a bunker even a fancy one for years isnt enjoyable and certainly not sustainable for long no matter how wealthy"
Whatreally123I keep seeing ppl making that response The ppl that won’t have jobs will die It’s that simple It happens to this day You think America is so great but yet ppl die here from starvation and crime all the time Look suicide rate for middle aged white males is 40 suicide from lgbtq is 50 1 in 4 women are on antidepressants more women attempt suicide than men Birth rates all across the globe are going down Truth is the ppl that are extremely smart and useful and adaptive will survive and those who aren’t will die That simple Population will go from 9 billion to like 1 billion Most elitist believes in eugenics already

i guess we will have to turn to socialism when we lose all these jobsalready feeling the effects of this
All of these salaries will drop when everyone is out of a job
teachers have a big union thats the reason they were not replaced by videotapes 20 years ago
Ai wouldn’t complain about coming to work on time doing tedious jobs working OT or even working extra days for better upgradesrollingonthefloorlaughing
Skilled trades jobs will be fine for a long time until the robots are ready to boot our butts
they dont need robots for that  all the whote collar people that get fired wont just roll over and die  we live in a real world not a cartoon  theyll retrain and flood the trade jobs while undercutting because they are desperate to get the foot in the wages in trades will go straight to the ground  use your brain how do you not see it lmao
not really if half the population is unemployed then there will be significantly less demand for tradesman since people wont have  to spend
Pretty much anything a human can do AI will eventually be able to do and do it better Its just the logical extrapolation as long as AI progress is always being made
I doubt it
What a bunch of horse shit Humans have no chance against AI in the long term There is no adaptation to this The thing we made is called intelligence By definition it can adapt faster Were screwed in the long term By long term I mean 1015 years There will be no jobs Probably not even money It will be a good world probably if we all manage to stay alive

Not until the robots can do the work so enjoy your time as a plumber until the robots are here to replace you Respect to you though for being a plumber keeping homes from failing
of course it will affect you  all tye white collar workers wont just roll over and die theyll retrain into trades flood the job market while being desperate  and drive wages down to the ground  and since a lot of people will be fired  there will be less demand since people cant pay  so oversupply of workers and decrease in demand  say goodbye to well paying trade jobs  remember people like PBD who want to fire people are not your firends

One argument he didn’t make is liability If we reached the holy grail of AI technology to replace everyone there will still be jobs where leadership  ownership need people to take the heat if something goes wrong or else they will be responsible from an image legal or financial standpoint
We need robot and automation tax along with universal basic income for lower to middle class
 yet Obiden  his administration still stroll around saying that there are all these open jobs out there More BS from JB
It’s not about politics I would say it’s innovation As much as we are advancing more companies would prefer to transport their wages overseas and make production cheaper Or even get AI so the robots would work for free It’s not a question of politics it’s a question of greediness Most bosses and CEO’s will still be at the top Therefore for you to beat the system is by being them

Pew doesnt know anything  WEC doesnt know anything  They are all wrong and theyve all completely missed the mark and so has PBD and this video  You have no idea where AI is heading  No training available today is going to prepare you   I highly encourage you to get your hands on a prospectus for OpenAI and educate yourself a bit more because it pains me to say youre wrong on this this is NOT just automation  This is NOT comparable to prior historical innovations that create new opportunity folks really need to stop with this default argument because they are not thinking  The goal of OpenAI is to produce an intelligence that is capable of doing ALL ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE LABOR better faster and CHEAPER than ANY human can do  Read that AGAIN  No new opportunities that an AI cant already do better only a few elites will direct the AI agents  OpenAI in their prospectus WARNS their investors that they really should consider their investment a donation since if they achieve their goals they dont know how money and economic models will break when you have the complete devaluation of human labor  Yes for a time probably the next 10 years human labor and innovation will be needed to bring this type of AI into existence but after AGI is achieved everything breaks  Im not talking about stopping this to preserve our current economical model you cant stop this but folks REALLY need to open their minds to something very radically different  We used to think that if we didnt own our own labor we were effectively indentured servants but what if there is simply NO value to ANY labor  Wake up folks We are talking about a machine that will do our THINKING for us there is no historical context for this we are in completely uncharted waters and soon humanity will have an abundance  of time

I love that Im in a trade What worries me the most is that the older I get the less people there are in the trades to replace the guys retiring I make almost 100k a year to hang fire protection system in buildings You cant have a robot do my job Its safe It pays very well It requires zero formal education The competition in the industry is shrinking and my value rises each passing year that less people enter the trades  I highly recommend others follow in my steps and join the trades We NEED you
AI will design buildings that will make that obsolete also
AI is just a type of technology  a technology that has be taught and applied We still dont know how to use the EV technology let alone this one

AI might be able to replace some jobs but there will always be a need for human creativity and innovation Lets embrace the future and adapt
Besides it is not like people is going to try to do everything by themselves by using Ai it wont work like Ok chat gpt pay my taxes there here is my data just do it If we keep in mind all the job it has behind and all the questions and precise prompts human has to do
90 of the world will be unemployed But hey lets embrace the future and adapt If people cant make their own money they will need the government Hello communism
Emanuelyb3qk I think it will work pretty much like that but you dont need to even promt anything Why do you think it would not work like that
Not just some itll replace a good majority of the kinds of jobs businesses once valued humans for And while I agree there will always be a place for human creativity the fact that our economy distributes survival resources like food and shelter based on the concept of having a job really needs to change
"you think majority of humans are creative  innovative to make a dent in the grand scheme of things NO This is not like how technological advancements have changed industries before The car replaced the horse cart but the guy driving the cart could move to driving the car Same role different tool Or when robots were introduced in factories Same workforce but different skill which was still physical work or when computers became the norm 
All technological advances have only replaced the tools and not the humans using them to a large degree Only now with AI are we seeing the lack of humans This is nowhere like how technology has impacted in the past 
The economy is centred on people with jobs If people lose jobs and more work can be done for far less where will humans go And how will governments get taxes 

Not everyone is creative nor innovative Most humans are more adept at phyiscal work and a minute percentage are the creative and innovative 

Specially for people over 40 reinventing oneself at that age will be very very tough Scary times ahead"
Whatreally123 Thank you The amount of people that would lose their jobs is staggering Sure there might be some jobs that are safe but its like do you really need how many millions of people being teachers plumbers pipe layers etc Its like if you want to replace the jobs are you also going to make AI then gathergrow peoples food or take care of basic needs Highly doubt it
"bhar2855 if a majority of people lose their jobs and finances then by extension the other people whose jobs are safe will also not get work cos who will be able to afford their services I am foreseeing anarchy in 3040 years time 
Prior to the digital revolution all humans could make a decent living With the digital revolution the wage gap has exploded And now with the AI revolution itll be destructive 
Imo too many people are oblivious to how this will affect things or too naive or optimistic about adapting to change 
The movie Up in the Air where despair of people getting fired is apt for whats coming

"NikoKun  our economy distributes survival resources like food and shelter based on the concept of having a job
Do you mean trading  Exchaning our productivity Having a worth Offering something to others in return of services and products offered by others There is a thing called diminished returns Mass slace automation is definetly on that side of things"
AtomickPixel No are you considering the implications of AI I just mean we wont be able to expect people compete against AI more intelligent capable and cheaper than they are So we must find a different way to organize society Trade and such will still exist but the survival of people cannot continue to be determined based on whether they can find a traditional job Survival resources will have to be a given and people will still find ways to be productive in their communities Focusing on exactly how is impossible to predict at this stage
"When the tractors and machines came it weren’t a big need for horses and riders But it was okay Due to the more productivity there were need for people to load and unload do accounting some drove the tractor some went into repairs 

This replaces the horse  the tractor the driver the loaders the accountant the shopkeeper and soon the repairmen 

That’s okay you think the worker will just go into town and find a new job When he is there he notices that machines are making burgers the receptionist at the hotel is artificial the bank teller is a screen the taxis drives themselves 

This is a different beast We are outsourcing the only thing that makes most of us valueable in modern society intelligence"
AtomickPixel FYI trading and exchanging our productivity for any kind of value never goes away Capitalism MAY go away because AI invalidates a big part of it but do not mistake those concepts for capitalism itself they exist outside of and independent from capitalism

Im an electrician when tradesmen say they cant be replaced I laugh look how much has changed in last 8 years hell last 4 years you and I know it only takes 4 years to get a journeyman license Now if you think 90 million people loosing their job is not going to effect you trades could get flooded with they probably will as people will think construction is safe from ai and robots It would not surprise me if they tore down EVERY THING and then ai and robots could take all trades out they have the money and it will eventually pay for itself and if you think Im crazy would you think this would be our reality in 2024 as much evil in the world nothing surprises me amy more look how atrocious AI is with bias
Looking at the ponctuation definitely an AI wrote this comment
I never said I could spell good spelling grammar has never been my strongest subjects
But AI and robots can replace 70 percent of all trades in less than a year shit they could do it now but to much money investigate how many people are really being laid off RIGHT now not on mainstream media do real investigation And you dont they that the jobs that are lost now they have to trickle into the other sectors that have not been impacted Yet but that changes everyday  You all can think its fear mongering if it is then you should be able to prove me wrong with real numbers and facts no hear say  Thanks I just want the world to get better but its just getting worse the things they swore would enhance our life has just caused stress jealousy envy in most no human connection how much productivity is lost smart phones u think the ones running billions want that
What has allegedly so fundamentally changed regarding being an “electricianjourneyman” that demonstrates that AI is such a threat Use logic and evidence REAL statistics not just fearm ongering
Its gana make school pretty much erelevent other then just your basics The world of people is composed of people but now with AI there taking humanity out of humanity The ultra rich are evil but the thing is is that pushing this is an oxymoron cuz they figure they can make more money by getting rid of the majority of human labor but there also complete killing the majority of consumers So thelle have robots but no consumers But yes I been saying it for a long time and from studying in my opinion I think like 70 percent of people will have no jobs with this AI garbage Society is gana explode

danielvelkovski3156 facts I’m in college right now and I would probably have terrible grades if it wasn’t for YouTube and google
Educators themselves are struggling in modern America I took my kids out of public school because of the absolute incompetence They’re now being taught by teachers with a passion to teach
danielvelkovski3156I blame the American school system as a whole for your misunderstanding other countries are teaching kids far earlier and content that actually matters with techniques that are better than the American system I’m American but I love how Asians do and learn math it just makes more sense and now I know why they’re so skilled in it
Dontrolling you’re right My foreign Polish friends told me the math they learned as kids in Poland is what we were doing in highschool It was a joke to them I’m convinced the school system here wants us dumbed down We never learn money managementinvesting or anything about taxes
itskeagan3004 that’s awesome I wish more parents would follow your lead Lots of school now have metal detectors Ours brought in drug sniffing dogs on occasion lol Only getting worse
In class you go at the pace of the slowest I agree that teachers will be replaced and more kids may be home schooled Classes will be more efficient and there will be fewer biases

"I paid big bucks to go to grad school so I could go to class and get spoon fed an education I could have learned the same stuff by watching videos but you cant ask questions to a video You dont learn from your peers experiences and insights from a video  You dont get homework graded from a video to make sure you fully grasp the concepts  

Plus there is no way I would have the discipline to sit down every week and learn complex concepts on my own"

"Liamvb3xo Sadly my friend hitting your teacher or destroying classroom equipment no longer carries the same consequences as it once did Theres tons of videos on X showing that and many of these kids get a slap on the wrist

I work as Softsare Engineer and totally have been sitting over a screen and leaarned what I do by myself What is your point
domenicorutigliano9717 1 ure an adult  2 Kids need to be socialized Have human connections Learn how to behave in a social setting 3 Also a good caring teacher can be a lifesafer for some with neglecting parents So I do think they can learn with online material only I think the mental health aspect is just too much neglected this way

AI is on exponential growth we don’t have long before it affects us
Bye bye 20 per hr fast food workers in California
Patricks insights on AIs impact on the job market are spot on Its worth noting that while AI may replace certain tasks it often creates new roles in AI supervision maintenance and development that require a more advanced skill set Upskilling is key for entrepreneurs to leverage AI rather than compete against it
Youre wrong humans wont be needed for AI maintenance and development Those will be AI jobs as well Robots will be maintained and supervised by AI The new jobs created will be few and far between Since no one will work we will need government assistance Welcome to communism
It creates positions that oversee the function of AI but it still results in a net loss of jobs

Your comment is so naive
​johnnastrom9400exactly everyone in these comments are NOT taking human nature into consideration
We have already seen what more and more automation leads tomore entertainers scrambling around and hustling for money  I wonder what the upper limit to that will be or if that will simply be not an option when AI gets better at that
its about time
Bullshit They have been saying this for 10 years AI will hurt computer programming But I work in a warehouse they try for years to get AI to get rid of us AI would work for 2 hours then clash Also it gave those tech guys that build the AI tech too much power Because they became partners instead of employees
This also means the people still in work will get PAID MORE hustle and stay competitive always
No it doesnt
no it means the people who are still left employed will be paid scraps supply and demand

davidmajor1508Name one time tech has resulted in lower prices ever Prices will NEVER EVER GO DOWN AGAIN It would take a hard landing and full on recession which they are doing their damnest to avoid
"MrGbustamante 
Tech has continuously lowered costs in REAL TERMS that is after adjusting for inflation or income and sometimes even in ABSOLUTE TERMS without having to adjust for inflation andor incomes

A good example of ABSOLUTE TERMS is computers  Today we can buy a laptop for a few hundred bucks a computer with EQUIVALENT capabilities would have cost OVER 1000’s of dollars to buy 30 years ago…"
"MrGbustamante 
However most of the time to appreciate the fact that technologymachines have lowered prices one has to adjust for inflation andor incomes— there is a reason after all that I said “in real term terms” or did you not understand the meaning “In real terms” means what I just said adjusting for inflation andor incomes

For instance adjusting for INFLATION AND INCOMES that is in REAL TERMS PRECISELY due to technology and machines the real price of food is lower than ever people well except for the last couple of years where INFLATION has raised prices to the point where that is BRIEFLY no longer true But BREIF circumstances don’t establish long run trends and the LONG RUN TREND IS FOR FOOD AND OTHER PRODUCTS to be cheaper in REAL terms"
listen wagie whats going to happen when millions of white collar workers are laid off  Many will migrate to blue collar jobs Your competition will increase exponentially and your wages will plummet So no jobs are safe
They will automate manual jobs as well Additionally competition will only intensify once a large wave of workers from whitecollar jobs are laid off and migrate to the bluecollar job market Your pay will only decrease due to AI automation even if it doesnt directly affect your job There are no safe jobs

This economically  illiterate fearmongering over “technology will take all our jobs” is nothing new and it is wrong now as it ever was"
davidmajor1508 AI will indeed enhance productivity in the short term potentially lowering the costs of goods and services which could boost demand However due to the substantial investments funneling into AI development—amounting to trillions—the trend is leaning more towards the automation of jobs While this automation might lower prices and increase demand its important to recognize that the demand for human labor could shift rather than outright increase In the current AI landscape this shift might not significantly replace jobs in fields like engineering or programming Yet as AI evolves over the next 1020 years the nature of job demand is expected to change substantially
"jryn4lk 
Yes of course the demand for labor will shift with automation— as it has ALL ALONG As the cost of goods and services will substantially decrease  in real terms it will cause the LONG RUN demand for labor to SHIFT to the right in other words it will cause the demand for labor to increase as mechanization and automation ALWAYS has

This rightward shift of the demand curve for labor often coupled with a leftward shift of the supply curve is ONE of the reasons that wages and salaries a likely to increase for almost all workers after a major change in technology or automation that increases productivity"
"jryn4lk 
And yes OF COURSE the nature of jobs demanded will change due to AI— all technologies that revolutionize work and productivity do that That’s nothing new"
"jryn4lk 
AI AND “automation” will enhance productivity  not just in the “short term” but in the LONG RUN ALSO as ALL technologies have"
"jryn4lk 
I honestly don’t understand why people act as though “automation” is some new phenomenon"
"jryn4lk
Automaton has been going on ever since man invented tools to help with and replace his labor

I suppose someone could split hairs and say that it was “mechanization” not “automation” but that ignores the fact that it’s all the same thing in the end the application of machines to tasks once performed by human beings 

It significantly picked up pace during the Industrial Revolution spawning misguided movements like the Luddite’s who were textile workers who had been replaced by mechanized looms and knitting machines aka essentially “automation” and who made the very same arguments that technology was going to take everyone’s jobs leaving everyone impoverished due to declining wages etc 

The Luddites were wrong then as history has shown and people making similar arguments today are just as wrong as the Luddites were"

AI will start to teach itself and get to a point where you wont need lots of those AI related jobs   When AI just needs someone to tell it what to do and no longer needs the person to do the code for a task then anyone can do that   Most back office supportprocessingoperations related roles can and will be replaced by AI  My dad always said the free market always creates new jobs when others are replaced  I just think that concept may be hitting a wall with AI and robotics  My job is process improvement and AI is starting to infiltrate the field and more and more items robots are processing  The Fed will need to address this coming mass unemployment that will be here in the next 510 years
The will address it by socialism
Depends on solution  Socialism is one potential outcome through social services needed due to massive unemployment However other alternatives by the fed addressing it is encouraging a change to education and encouraging trades over college   However you cant indoctrinate trades like a mailable college student I am also a believer that at some point machines can essentially replace humans in almost every task  This brings a larger discussion again at a global level of how society will potentially operate in a future where people are not needed to work  This is not as simple as tossing around isms to try to box a solution into one that fits into todays understanding of economics where work  reward when there is no work as we know it in the future

Lawyers and judges will certainly be affected It may take longer for it to affect surgeons but dont be so quick to think they wont be replaced 

A lot of jobscareers will be affected Some may not be completely replaced by machines but may enhance the work of the people 

This may sound scary but it may have an overall positive outcome How many people are working and are miserable doing what they do Itll be most of those crappy jobs thatll be gone Truckers bus drivers couriers They will also be affected soon because theyve already put selfdriving buses and trucks on the road Pilots may be next This may seem bad and maybe there will be issues with peoples mental health for a bit boredom and not knowing what to do with yourself may cause issues but eventually people will start taking better care of themselves physically mentally and spiritually and we may see humans and machines working in tandem for exponential societal development"

"We really need to have a conservative effort to educate people on what AI really means It is so misused it is laughable For example if you have a system that receives emails with application forms and those forms are picked up by a process parsed and that data added to a database thats not AI If you take a photo of yourself and a photo of Arnold Schwarzenegger and you push a button and it puts your face on Arnolds body thats not AI These are just programs that do a specific task Its automation Hell Gemini isnt all AI I am a programmer Weve had code generators for years You give some programs some parameters and itll generate code The only difference is that nowadays the code that is generated requires fewer parameters and creates more sophisticated code My job wont go away because there will still need to be someone telling AI what to create and no matter how sophisticated the AI is it will never create something that perfectly fits your requirements Ill still need to review what it creates and incorporate it into the system AI is not autonomous nor will it ever be I predict

What we really should be taking away from this is the charts he showed Forget AI those numbers reflect what kinds of jobs different people have No education youre probably in the trades a career that cant be replaced by AI Asians are highly dependent on computer related jobs The data is far more telling about the state of the US than the state of AI"

Hey people… You know if we just don’t support businesses who do this they won’t do it Post attention people
If AI takes all the jobs and no one has money who’s going to buy all the goods and services 
"They have a plan for that and you will not like it You have to realize that if the establishment owns 90 of everything the value of that 90 no longer matters Money will only exist as an idea in the form of CBDCs which you will receive as universal basic income The catch is you will only be able to spend it on what they want you to 100 of your UBI will already be accounted for in spending categories they have chosen for you savings will not be possible Your UBI allocation will also be dependent on you meeting social norms they have set up for you You will be discouraged from acting out with losses in privileges the things they let you buy with your CBDC If that doesnt keep you in line they will just turn off your funds If that doesnt work they will offer you MAID for your depression If that doesnt work you dont want to know

Your question about who is going to buy all the goods and services assumes that all the goods and services that are available today will exist in the new world order hence why you cannot grasp what is coming Nearly all the goods and services you have today will be gone it will be bare basics only Not to mention imagine every fun thing you like to do today for pay items and free ones like going to the beach Now imagine what they will be like on a day when everyone has everyday off You will be limited in how far you can go via your CBDC You will be limited on how far your voice can be heard via social media controls You will be limited on how you can act out via full time surveillance It will be a virtual prison

I have a programming background but I work as a lead at a service desk currently and I havent written code in a daily basis in over a decade  However I do build tools for my desk if I see opportunities for improvement  

Im currently working on a few projects which will result in less calls to my service desk and will make it easier for my techs to solve issues quickly  These arent big projects  One project is a diff tool based on access rights  It will make it easier for techs to compare 2 users in order to see why one user can access a resource while someone else cant in order to correct permissions  Ive used AI to parse files write some logic build some interfaces etc  I know what the end result was going to be but I used AI to help get me there  

Im also currently building a runbook for the desk  While building it I asked my AI what were the most common sections that should be in a service desk runbook than I asked it what were the most common questions that should be in each section of the runbook and kept working down the chain  By the end I had a ton of template structure written out which I still needed to get answered but now we have a guide on what questions need to get answered  I use it to template knowledge articles as well  I built 50 templates for common scenarios in 2 hours  They still need to be completed formatted and cleaned up but one of my KB managers isnt working from scratch  

AI is a productivity booster  Use it well and it can benefit you  Hell you can just have it write up some logic to build your code around"
AI multiply productivity so less people do all the work at the same time consumption has not multiplied
​OneManCanStopTheMotorOfWorldjust see Claude Ai you will be shocked its great at math then graduates
"unspacelaw yea I work as a dev and also develop  machine learning solutions and algos
I’m well aware of what it can do I stand on my words 

Ai is overhyped Language prediction models are no substitute for a Sr Dev  The tech is just not there yet 510 years  maybe I run my own company as well
 I’ll be just fine regardless As for Jr and entry level devs yeah I’d say their time is limited"
Help is not equal to replacing Have you try to get help from a AI
AI is going to replace them with black vikings managed by a black pope entertained by a black snow white
I’m a Computer science major and  republican but I don’t see the government allowing AI to replace 85 million jobs That would theoretically mean 85million people without jobs and no one will will have money to buy anything There’s laws for that kind of stuff like why you can’t pay employees dirt cheap why you have them pay them for PTO or sick days or why you can’t fire someone for having a baby
The governments in most places dont do much to help citizens except Libertarian politicians like Rand Paul
I think we are still far away from AI taking jobs from people just try to implement AI today its a joke

⁠I keep seeing ppl making that response The ppl that won’t have jobs will die It’s that simple It happens to this day You think America is so great but yet ppl die here from starvation and crime all the time Look suicide rate for middle aged white males is 40 suicide from lgbtq is 50 1 in 4 women are on antidepressants more women attempt suicide than men Birth rates all across the globe are going down Truth is the ppl that are extremely smart and useful and adaptive will survive and those who aren’t will die That simple Population will go from 9 billion to like 1 billion Most elitist believes in eugenics already
May be it will become a socialist economy where humans do nothing and go merrily do their own fun things while governments pay you monthly stipend to buy your necessities  smilingfacewithsunglasses
"Industries will gradually pivot from serving the consumer masses to serving a smaller ultra elite class  Companies will pivot or die and new ones will rise to serve this class
Example of pivoting billionaires will want their own private drone armies to protect their factories So companies will need to exist to create the components for those drones from mining the metals to automated steel mills to circuitboard manufactures to plastics manufacturing companies to micro chip designing and fabricating companies to camera manufacturing companies for the drones vision system  
 
Ok thats just the defense or security systems for the ultra wealthy what about businesses that serve their extravegant lifestyles theyll want to live in luxury so companies will need to exist that can make smaller quantities of extremely luxurious goods and services"
chriswilson1968I mean what’s the point of money at that point
peterwilkinson1975 Its all that really separates us from them They need it
"chriswilson1968 Yea this is my question People say “new jobs will be created” but… I mean seems like just tech jobs AI maintenance AI Ethics etc but once factory jobs are gone they are gone Once cashiers are gone they are gone

They say it should drive production prices and overall cost of goods down because AI will be MUCH cheaper than actual employees but still doesn’t answer the question of… what will the jobs even be 

We can’t ALL become plumbers and electricians Those jobs will fill up quickly when people realize it’s all they can get"

Whenever there is human innovation there is always more work We have all this technology but work more hours than we did in the farming days We should be having a 35 hour 4 day work week but people are working at least 5060 usually It does look like ubi is the way but im sure theyll find something for people to do people think ohh more tech training and most of society will be in the tech field I just dont see that people such at math and cant even figure out how to order stuff off Amazon hehe Even so im sure theyll find something for people to do and for more hours too

They will automate that as well Additionally competition will only intensify once a large wave of workers from whitecollar jobs are laid off and migrate to the bluecollar job market Your pay will only decrease due to AI automation even if it doesnt directly affect your job

If this really happens then it could destroy the US as we are a consumer spending nation If massive amounts of people lose their jobs then they cant buy the unnecessary shit we Americans love Businesses will go under people wont be able to afford their homes or apartments food leisure spending etc Im curious to see how this plays out
The people excited for this are going to get a rude awakening
"its a dangerous thing for the economy and not just for the US If people lse jobs they wont have money to spend thus less purchasing and less profit for the corporations And less tax money for the governments This is not like technological advances before where they have disrupted a market but created another one where humans would be required AI will eliminate people in certain jobs and also affect the businesses of others due to less demand 
As an Indian in the IT sector this is crazy scary If AI can reduce human requirement even by 20 we are looking at a huge loss And what if majority of IT outsourcing is reduced cos AI can do the heavy lifting Our economy will also be destroyed 
Scary times ahead"
Whatreally123 fully agreed I have a friend that works in investment banking in NYC and hes absolutely terrified of AI because he knows it could easily do his high paying job AI could do lawyers jobs accounting data analysis and AI doesnt need work hours it can work 247 AI doesnt need labor unions or vacations haha I work for State Farm and AI could 100 do my well paying job and we all know a companys highest expense is their payroll Worrying times indeed

irakliasatiani The idea is the money that would have gone to people working at the establishment that are now out of a job would still end up in peoples pockets regardless Basically an AI tax that goes toward some level of basic income Intelligence is being replaced and that replaces people that need to work to survive Theres no other solution to this

Ditto if you work with EBikes
​larryhouse3776Bicycles are the Future
Robots will handle that simple task
Ik in San Diego CA bicycle mechanics are a dime a dozen but they also do decent and now you must know way more as alot of people are getting electrical bikes as you dont need a license like a moped and they only are legally sold at going up to 25 mph which is still alot but people obviously manipulate them and you can see people on electric bikes going 70mph which is like extremely dangerous But still a bike that goes 25mph that propels itself for like 1500 to 2000 on the low end is a good investment for someone that have no license but need independence and reliability  And if your in the city most often youll almost never need to go over 25mph

Sorry PBD Youre not entirely accurate Videos are NOT done in seconds It still takes creativity and iterations to get the rendering properly This could take hours But AI will make the process more efficient and more accessible to more people Im a programmer and ChatGpt makes my job more efficient But without my experience and discernment the tool is useless in the hands of a novice Yes many will lose their jobs Thats ok But the net result is positive
As a teacher most kids would not do well with AI as their teacher unless the parents are heavily involved Of course there are those amazing self driven students but so many of them want their knowledge spoon fed to them I try and get my students to use AI and they struggle coming up with what to even ask the AI
"Thats because most AI products right now are geared towards an adult minded orientation But theres a lot of development underway focused on children It will get very easy for kids to use AI in the coming years

You should read what Khan Academy is doing with Education using AI"
kamu747 I agree I see AI in the classroom as a force multiplier not a replacement for teachers In K12 there will always be a need for licensed classroom teachers Where I can see AI potentially replacing a lot of adjunct teachers is in College All those cost savings will go into the schools pockets and its vast bureaucracy it will not be reflected in tuition savings for the students and parents
As a teacher I 100 agree
I was a teacher I was a principal I know that 70 of the teachers in your building aren’t worth a shit I think AI should give it a chance I bet they cannot do you the fact is you probably don’t have a creativity to understand what AI will do It won’t just be some program or some “online“ thing it’ll be beyond what you can imagine and it will replace you I’ll be happy when all the schools close down it’s a terrible institution
oldtimeycabins I feel so sorry for any teacher that had you as a principal if thats what you feel about teachers There are plenty of crazy ones online posting their brainwashed tik Tok but that is not the majority of teachers at least not where I am in a conservative state
beat me probably to it kamu747
Ai would 100 percent replace teachers you dont even have to go to school anymore you can be homeschooled with ai education and less school shootings and bullying from the students
underratedgod6899 thats why I said parents would need to be involved How many kids and teenagers do you know who will sit down at a computer and learn without an adult being involved Homeschooling is of course a better replacement for public school Im not taking about that though
thedigitalmediateacher5544  ai could probably monitor everything that a normal public school would do the only reason people go to school these days is for the sake simply passing school aswell as the social aspect of it but with ai everything will be monitored from grades and how far you could further educate yourself aswell as ask questions from an ai hopefully it will be government regulated so there wont be any pronouns gender studies like what the college students are doing these days
thedigitalmediateacher5544 parents would definitely need to be involved just cause with ai it would be easier for students to cheat on an exam without any supervision but as far as teachers teaching students it will eventually become obsolete in the future
oldtimeycabins I dont agree with the accusation that 70 of teachers are shit but I agree education is ready for a significant disruption and it wont be pretty
Replace the teachers with ai would insure the kids are taught the same everywhere  Without the teachers personal  political views creeping in to the classroom Theres alot of bad teachers out there but who are happy to get the benefits and such Where else do a person work 9 months out of a year  with every imaginable holiday and personal and sick days  a pension that is under the same rules as the congress and Senates pension and is replaceable of money is lost Then teachers say their underpaid compared to others  but they factor their income on a 12 month scale when only working 9 months  Extend the figures out to if was actually  working 12 months  I was married to a teacher and family thats teachers and know whats going on Many are a bunch of crybabies who never worked in a factory job or busted their ass working hard like the people paying taxes to pay the salaries
glennzlotowski8020  thats exactly My point the government could save alot of money on education fundings ones ai teaching is enforced they dont need to fund public school instead it could be used on struggling families or homelessness instead the truth is alot of students dont like the idea of waking up in the morning to get ready for school when they can just be homeschooled and they could study at any moment they like
lotowski8020 that is a terrible idea Who do you think controls the AI Big corporations do Do you know what AI cannot do that teachers can console a student when their mother is dying of cancer in the hospital Or help a student who is being abused at home Teachers are not only there to teach Teachers are also friends and role models I think your opinion comes from a bitter petty place
glennzlotowski8020 instead youll get the political views of who ever programs the AI as of right now I dont trust AI programming at all Have you seen the bias current AI has
Telling by how poorly you express yourself I doubt you were a teacher Even if you were you probably didnt last very long let alone be a principal oldtimeycabins

I remember whe social media first came out FB etc everybody said this is the greatest thing and jumped on board 2024 social media is one of the worst things for society  especialy for young people  AI will be next worst things

Atleast someone else noticed
AI will ruin lives
"Of course AI will be one of the worst Its not going to be Jetsons
But if you notice humans like to vote for stupid things like war every few decades when there is safety
So they are all excited to see these AIs knowing it will be like Terminator"
The road to hell is paved with good intentions Maybe we should stop paving the road and take a pause to think about whats truly beneficial for humanity
Ai can be used in medicine and researchscience so we can get more solutions for problems that were hard to be solve in a long period of time
adrianfarcas2063 No
The coming AI revolution is way more comparable to industrial revolution than the recent breakthroughs weve had it would make social mediainternet look like nothing but basic technology The near infinite application of advanced AI will spike our productivity levels through the roof just like how steam and electricity made us so much more productive But the only concerning difference is how were gonna transition to it and how will it affect our way of life its probably not as bleak as it sounds mainly because no matter how advance this technology can get I highly doubt we will ever allow it to have a complete hold over our destiny as a species which is why leadership roles will never be replaced if anything we will most likely try to have some form of symbiotic relationship with these chips to make ourselves smarter and more productive

15 of finance soon to be more
40 of development and coding

Moreover in many teams weve replaced an onshore team of 5 to 10 people with a now

onshore team of 2 to 3 and offshore team of 2 to 4

Offshore guys use the AI built and managed by onshore guys

For developers it won’t be that simple to replace us I use ai when I get stuck n it’s helpful but the reason why I think it’ll be harder to replace us is because of trust Developers need access to multiple system to do our job and no company is gonna give ai unlimited access to to their entire business
"AI will lower the costs of production which will in turn lower the cost to the consumer which will increase REAL aggregate demand  including demand for items and products and services currently considered uneconomical or “luxury” which will in turn increase demand for jobs ranging from machine maintenancerepair to healthcare services to engineers and high end programmers and coders etc

Economically illiterate fear mongering over “the machines will take all our jobs” is nothing new and it’s as misguided and wrong now as it ever was"
​hobbyxplorer exactly this It would be a huge risk to have ai handle millions of lines of code because if the ai gets hacked your company sinks Developers have limited permissions and have to work together to reduce risk
I mean Mckinseys Study does suggest that lower wage American are in for a tough time by 2030 but it also supports your notion of certain sectors being likely to experience a period of massive growth and thus subsequent need for more employees in said roles to support such demands But youre right it is like how it is always been adapt to the changes or face consequences  Its nothing new davidmajor1508
Would love to connect on Facebook
"​davidmajor1508 I put some thought into this

I forget where but I heard once someone say there is no rule in economics that says more technology makes more better jobs for more people

All of our prior innovations were akin to mechanical muscles enabling us to all but eliminate a significant proportion of physical labour work thru automation or offshoring

AI is like mechanical brains enabling us to automate or offshore a lot of thinking work

There really are only 2 kinds of work humans to Physical and Mental

The hallmark of advanced economies is that a majority of the work is thinking work which was hard to automate or offshore Until now

Moreover it doesnt take 100 unemployment to break an economy It only takes like 12

Also industrial and farming before automation and offshoring took decades Ai improvement and rollout is frictionless

I dont think all the jobs will be gone

I think enough of the jobs will be gone at a fast enough pace that we wont be able to mange it with cross training and there wont be a replacement job for many for some time"
"Foof0811 
No not all of our prior innovations “were akin to ‘mechanical muscles’” 

Computers are not even close to being “mechanical muscles” for instance

You clearly need to put more thought into this"
"Foof0811 
You are arguing in circles You proclaim
Moreover it doesnt take 100 unemployment to break an economy It only takes like 12

You have not established that it will be anywhere near 12 you have just asserted it and no your follow up statement I think enough of the jobs will be gone at a fast enough pace that we wont be able to mange it with cross training and there wont be a replacement job for many for some time  is just ANOTHER unsupported assertion and does NOT support your claim about 12 as it is an unsubstantiated assertion 

In other words I see ZERO attempt on your part to do REAL economic analysis as there is NO mention on your part regarding PRODUCTIVITY PRICES SUPPLY AND DEMAND etc

You say that you have put some thought into this but clearly you need to put more as you have no REAL economic analysis and you make PATENTLY false claims such as all prior innovations were akin to mechanical muscles

You need to put MORE thought into this and consider doing REAL economic analysis"
"Foof0811 
And thinking work has LONG been BOTH automated and offshored

Computers automated a LOT of aspects of thinking work such as automating bookkeeping and CODING and PROGRAMS are also a form automating considerable aspects of thinking work 

Moreover offshore ENGINEERING and call centers are indeed a way of offshoring thinking work"
"Foof0811 
And the “pace of innovationjob destruction” being some form of “too fast” has LONG been a FALSE argument of those that think technology “destroys jobs”"
"Foof0811 
AI “improvement and rollout” is NOT “frictionless” contrary to your claim

There are indeed costs to implementing testing and improving the technology…and sometimes those costs particularly the upfront costs are considerable 


Really you have NO idea what you’re talking about"
"Foof0811 
Anyone who tells you that implementing AI is magically “frictionless” just doesn’t know what they are talking about…"
Advancement is not always a great thing Back in the day The Milk Man had some pretty sweet benefits
I appreciate your dedication to your vision but its crucial to maintain a fair and unbiased discussion Presenting a onesided perspective in this case focusing solely on Trumps greatness may limit the depth of the conversation Lets aim for a more balanced approach acknowledging both positive and negative aspects to foster a more comprehensive and informed discourse
Women are effected more
Im a welder there are some applications the AI and Machinery can be used to weld but for what I do is custom and on the Fly decisions have to be made
My boyfriend a welder in manufacturing plants He learned some coding and software stuff and now he is automation engineer with only a welding certificate If that interests you I highly recommend you looking into it grinningfacewithbigeyes the industry is unbelievably understaffed and needs people
The issue isnt so much whether AI and robots can do things like welding or other trades Tho eventually it might The issue is what happens when millions of workers displaced by AI start entering those trade industries and competing for those jobs Will there be enough jobs for everyone How much will they pay when theres that much competition
NikoKunexactly people in trades jobs think theyre more safe wrong the people laid off will them be swarming for their jobs and will ultimately probably be a race to the bottom pay wise
Lolfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoyfacewithtearsofjoy
​NikoKunpay for trade jobs will go down if a lot of people want to be employed
BYD has fully automated car plants Robots do all the welding
bubuneowoo6161 People dont get it Majority of jobs are not safe and there arent going to be anywhere near enough new types of jobs that pop up
listen wagie whats going to happen when millions of white collar workers are laid off  Many will migrate to blue collar jobs Your competition will increase exponentially and your wages will plummet So no jobs are safe
Ill be the guy integrating AI into business systems Ill be hated by 20 but at least Ill have a job
Same scenario as with industrial revolution technological revolution  People will find better opinions
No government jobs will be replaced you can Patrick Bet on that
The 40s n 50s old folks are scared that young people  and Outsource India Africa  will replace their them Old folks n younger folks are worried that outsourcing India and AI will replace take their jobs Outsourcing India is worried they’ll be replaced by AIfaceholdingbacktears
He’s wrong lawyers will definitely be affected

AI IS THINK VERY FAST Analytic WAY  IS NOT END OF THE WORLD    YES CHANGE IS INEVITABLE ONE LIKES IT OR NOT SO DO JOBS "
I say most STEM and trade skills will be the last ones to get replaced by AI
What will happen if millions of whitecollar workers are laid off Many may transition to bluecollar jobs leading to an exponential increase in competition and potentially significant decreases in wages Therefore even if AI cannot easily automate manual labor jobs it will still profoundly impact them

Perhaps this will bring about more at home mothers  parents  Teachers  with more at home parent households perhaps more at home school with curriculums available on line and  coop small group work done by groups of parents  Yes your 13 year old can do calculus  Will the human touch become the new luxury edge  The Luxury of better home life because you have a home manager  The luxury of excellent education and socialization of children  The luxury feel of a skilled editor using these AI tools   Im up for it    Example   Im all for robot fry cooks  A dangerous job that requires physical strength and stamina as well as brains  It is dangerous and repetitive Hard Work  People who do this job  have skills and intelligence that is better used elsewhere Many are not strong enough to do the constant leverage lifting required nor smart and focused enough to avoid burning themselves while doing repetitive work  The safety aspect requires intelligent mental toughness that not all people have This is why fry cooks are paid more not everyone can do the job   it is very hard  repetitive focused work That kind of talent can make more money doing a human job    Hey  if theyre danger junkies we need more linemen surveyors and fuel industry workers  high paying jobs requiring intelligence as well as strength  Definitely looking forward to these possibilities

Besides trades
"AI will vastly increase wealth and jobs

AI will lower the costs of production which will in turn lower the cost to the consumer which will increase REAL aggregate demand  including demand for items and products and services currently considered uneconomical or “luxury” which will in turn increase demand for jobs ranging from machine maintenancerepair to healthcare services to engineers and high end programmers and coders etc

​sammencia7945Would be the ideal postscarcity world
​pope1089Nope its the easiest
Noxturno Its the same there will be other jobs that AI cant do  Education for example jobs that require hands on with complex understanding Example house building boat building  Repairs for those same jobs  Famers will still have jobs as we have to have a human behind food security to pass quality checks  The list can go on  Yes the transition period will be rough but there will be other jobs
Who will pay taxes  AI doesn’t pay into a tax system  Our gov’t won’t stop spending money
Artist keep getting Fd by AI and the companies clamoring to use all their work in pools of IP theft It has to be regulated
I think the dismal results displayed by remote learning during lockdowns show in person learning at least through high school is demonstrably better So I do not see AI taking over the school system
With so many teachers quitting over teaching these brats who knows
Ai does the teaching and they hire lower paid babysitters to make sure they stay on task There are lots of great teachers but lots of terrible ones too  ai could probably replace the terrible ones pretty easily
Thats equal to  the hole population of  Southend Africa cryingface
Dey takin our jerbs
Valid threat for sure But Ill start worrying about it when AI can 4x4 up 6 steep canyon draws to break up cattle tank ice notice then repair the loose shaft brace and readjust flow tube knocked aside while up there tractor out alflafa bales move a thousand head of Angus and longhorns off the winter ranges with the stunning authority of horse and dog brand innoculate help with difficult births plow the damn access road get that pair of loose bulls back mount a thousandpound tractor tire then move on to  uh what was the question
Anything is possible
AI will find a replacement for cattle as a food source considering huge cattle farms are extremely polluting to the environment You just dont get it do you AI is creating lab grown meat
Unfortunately we will all be eating crickets or lab grown beef with a side of vegan milk  better begin worrying
Plumber and electrician stock is going up chartincreasingchartincreasing
This right here Also a robot will not fix itself Yet so learn robotics and how to fix them Have to beat the damn robots and AI at their own game
Nope get ready for the race to the bottom All the job looses will now have people doing the next best thing ai will train a plumber faster and effective when a hot shot electrician thinks he’s not going to be replaced a dozen people will be there ready to do it cheaper just to be able to eat
civil engineers as well car mechanic
Not to diss trades but get out of working under someone…huge opportunity for those who own their own companies especially those who were deep in it already
There will be tons of competition with those jobs
mostwantedmotor Not a chance Todays generation of people are beyond useless and AI isnt going to help them do st Do you think someone that has sat in an office for the last 20 years is going to get trained up on AI and take some tradespersons job That is literally one of the dumbest things I have ever heard in my life
mostwantedmotor A far bigger threat to the trades is mass immigration but even then the best out there will never be affected because they will always have the best clients
markadler8968 absolutely…when the other option is to be broke because your job is obsolete Hard times create hard people Ai can make times much harder…if it disrupt more jobs then it creates Just how numbers work Trades get a bad rap because it’s too much work for too little pay…it’s easier money to be made doing anything else…if that easy money dries up more people will have to do harder work…it’s no other option
"They have imported new laborers for that

ohiosteamandsteel Really what about the special forces all over the world They literally cannot find anyone to meet their standards anymore because they are all overweight out of shape or have no idea what ger they actually are For you to say that the so called men of today are even a fraction as manly as the men of the past is laughable
I’m not sure you’re understanding the situation AI loaded into specific robots will do it more precise efficient and faster and have permits basically built in Multimodal systems are serious and will be making this year
Im afraid even plumbers and electricians wont be unaffected at least by more indirect impacts of AI What happens when millions of workers displaced by AI in other industries spend a few years in classes then start entering those trade industries and competing for those jobs Will there be enough jobs for everyone when those are the only options left How much will they pay when theres that much competition
​NikoKun I cant help but wonder whod be left to hire them when most of their potential clients are out of work all thanks to AI taking over
"timbangjc Thats another aspect of this issue If AI ends up out competing so many people thatll cause consumer spending to plummet and lead to economic stagnation
Its a paradox that only seems to worsen as AI continues to improve And I cant see it creating anywhere near enough new jobs for everyone that it couldnt also do itself
I really think we need to start making major changes to how our society works whether or not it can provide a job for people they should still be able to live decently"
"So will private security law enforcement and prison guards Long story short Automation and AI will destroy countless jobs and professions
Crime homelessness poverty will skyrocket So will crime rates

You will need plenty of boots on the ground My job security guard is safe for at least another generation"
megacide84 That may work in fictional dystopia stories but it never works in reality for long especially not in the US And the pace of change AI will likely bring probably wont allow for that either beyond a short term riot period if those in power refuse to adapt
Trade work is usually changeresistant but never changeproof
NikoKun  nope not at all its called highly skilled labor you have to be skilled with your hands dont sell it short I seen many enter and fail dont act line everyone can do certain trade jobs cause they cant
"​angrybeavers1175 Dont pretend thatll matter one bit Also why I specified theyd spend a few years in classes What else do you expect people to do what else CAN they do when AI makes it their ONLY option You dont seem to realize the scale of whats coming
Sure not everyone can do trade jobs and that is ALSO a serious problem because we cannot let those people starve just because AI out competes them And the number of people who will increasingly get into the trade jobs that remain will cause an order of magnitude more competition which will cause pay rates to decline You cannot deny it
We now know no matter what we do we will never again put all Americans whore capable of work back to work We have to establish the social principle make it a part of our Constitutional way of life that a man is paid a decent wage whether or not this society can put him to work We must separate pay from work Bayard Rustin"
NikoKunlets say AI takes over all jobs who is going to be able to buy products from these big companies that implement it They wont be able to continue operations after awhile Unless UBICommunism becomes a thing That way everyone can be happy with a life of unemployment  still able to buy their necessitieswants
Very true except when those are the only jobs in town and more people will go into it suppressing wages  Plus you still need customers with money

chadthackston1992 As a systems engineer and a coder Im pretty certain that if I lose my job to AI Im going to find other engineers to work on projects to kill the jobs of those who still have them If Im jobless and hungry so are you

​MarcusVisbal This will never happen
sneakyninja5802 it’s literally what they thought was going to happen first lol and it absolutely will Sooner than anyone is anticipating with the pace of the tech as well
literally EVERYONE says become a plumber the job wont go away yall will he tearing eachother up for scraps Being uninvolved with the problem doesnt mean its fallout wont get you later
If the desk jobs are going  people will train to be plumbers and electricians there will be loads of tradesmen smilingfacewithsmilingeyes
If all these jobs those people work now get replaced by robots everyone will become a plumber and electrician It wont pay squat anymore do to all the newly qualified people
timbangjc​​⁠I keep seeing ppl making that response The ppl that won’t have jobs will die It’s that simple It happens to this day You think America is so great but yet ppl die here from starvation and crime all the time Look suicide rate for middle aged white males is 40 suicide from lgbtq is 50 1 in 4 women are on antidepressants more women attempt suicide than men Birth rates all across the globe are going down Truth is the ppl that are extremely smart and useful and adaptive will survive and those who aren’t will die That simple Population will go from 9 billion to like 1 billion Most elitist believes in eugenics already
mostwantedmotor AI cant train faster It takes experience because not all plumbing or electrical system is the same
​zerospace101you think retirement is an option facewithtearsofjoy
All this seems vague to me Being innovative and agile etc are great buzzwords but we have to be understanding that this is not usually simple A good example was the trend of telling truck drivers to learn to code anyone can code sounds good but you are wasting time and money unless you get to a skill level the job market demands not so trivial The biggest danger to our livelihoods is a race to the bottom with salaries Good luck everyone were going to need it

markadler8968 the fact that you labeled and entire generation of people as useless already tells me that argueing with you isnt worth it so Ill only send 1 message with my opinion If people cant get jobs they wont be willing to pay for an expensive electrician or plumber Electricians  plumbers will have to compete with inexperienced and cheap alternatives
justanothermind9449 People dont have to get jobs in order to pay someone The majority of my clients dont work and are independently wealthy I should clarify not all of the young people today are useless but the ones born in western countries certainly are They have absolutely no interest in doing anything other than staring blankly into their phones all day
justanothermind9449 The main threat to contractors is immigration These people come from countries that actually have a work ethic and want to succeed so they will work harder for a lower price The young kids in the west are no threat to anyone at all They area a bunch of docile meek lazy confused adult toddlers that will have to be taken care of their entire lives
SafeEffectivels2pl ok and years down the line when we have a ton of plumbers and electricians with experience what is that going to mean
"mostwantedmotor
Good point but nothing beats a established reputable tradesman It won’t matter how many cheaper guys come along"
"mostwantedmotor
I agree the only people working for someone in trades should be the ones learning the trade with the goal of owning their own business"
"markadler8968
Very true An established tradesman will do just fine"
This is all so stupid Why create things that will stamp ourselves out  What is the point of all if this just to end up in a worse position for everyone
Going up Thats funny Im a plumber and tring to find ppl that want to work is impossible Ppl have got lazy and AI jus makes it worse
lol if everyone is going for those job guess what pay go down
​angrybeavers1175exactly only so many tradesmen are tom brady level plenty others are just mac jones and Bailey zappe
​markadler8968 man no intentent to disrespect my brother and my cousin are electrician and I love them and cant do what they can but you really believe it would be difficult to someone who can get a higher degree to learn how to do it Usually trades are taken by the one not very capable of studying It is not easy but it is not math The point is that there will be incredible competition in those sector It is not college educated vs tradespeople it is the one who works for their money against the one who just gain rents rents dividends interests and royalties and soon the one without the machine vs the machine owners The system need to be changed
"Domionico Do you really think being an electrician requires less intellect than someone in a typical white collar job I am not an electrician myself but know several and it requires a fairly high degree of mathematics on a daily basis especailly on larger more complicated projects But that was not the point I was trying to make My point was that someone sitting in an office  their entire career wont be able to just switch jobs at the drop of a hat Even if they learn the intellectual part of the job there is still a very physical aspect to it that an office worker will never be capable of or will refuse to do

And that is just one trade Most other trades are far more physical than what an electrician endures in a day The average western born man simply wants no part of it What is a far bigger threat to tradesman is massive immigration where people come from a culture used to hard work and are driven to succeed because they have families to take care of Western born men are no threat to the trades and never will be I know I hire several every year"
Eh if anyone is still around to pay for any of that stuff
markadler8968 english is not my language I do not believe tradespeople are less intelligent education is not intelligence I know what I said is that usually they are not used to studying tons of stuff as one that went through highschool and college So the competition will be harsh cause probably the ones used to studying will learn how to do the job Maybe theyre soft and weak office worker maybe not I would not underestimate the power of will that comes from hunger This is the point There will be a lot of capacity to produce stuff but the system will not allow to distribute those stuff This will be a problem for everyone cause newbies will work for nothing and fucked the market for the job that will remain It is clearly an issue under capitalism
jghifiversveiws8729 businesses need plumbing and electricity to function last time I checked
Ive been a plumber for 23 years and I have to say I’ve seen a lot of people come and go in the trades It’s takes a certain type of mentality and ability to be successful It’s definitely not for everyone Just like certain types can’t be computer scientists or physicists or salesmen They all take natural abilities I think people are born with Just my opinion
Diverse Top also talked about some of these jobs
Problem is a lot of people will go after that more offer same demand price goes down
roddywhite4161 itd be smart to not pick the trades plumber or electrician but choose to repair robots instead im sure theyll be made so cheap they break down all the time
yoyojc5qg that I do agree with Im just tired of hearing people act like over saturation isnt going to happen to plumbers and electricians when it obviously will
mostwantedmotoryou know nothing about the trades facewithtearsofjoy Men made will always need man to fix it Spoken like a guy who has never touched a tool

Nothing is safe From line work to doctor there is a way to automate it The largest price for employers is the worker if they can shrink that cost by automation they will
Yup but these speculations don’t take into account that the current Global order is coming to end The end of large scale international trade How will AI fit into a world like this
"Which will lower the costs of production which will in turn lower the cost to the consumer which will increase REAL aggregate demand including demand for items and products and services currently considered uneconomical or “luxury” which will in turn increase demand for jobs ranging from machine maintenancerepair to healthcare services to engineers and high end programmers and coders etc

Economically illiterate fear mongering over “the machines will take all our jobs” is nothing new and it’s as misguided and wrong now as it ever was"

Have you seen what’s been happening to the robots out there This won’t go well
"Yeah What has been happening

Take from someone that followed robotics for 40 years you at best see polished demos for clickbait news articles

Robots today are no more able to do complex tasks than they were in 1989 Roboticists have spent 30 years just chasing the surface level scifi cool factor all the while the machine still requires a team of engineers offcamera to monitor the things to make sure the 2 million put into the RD doesnt break

No serious place of work has the money or time to deal with machines that you cant afford to get a dent doing most work"
Usually its human error that makes them bug out

"I have never thought AI could manipulate graphics and motion but I was wrong 

You literally work for an industry that was created via computersthat replaced a lot of guys that did stuff like rotoscope and stopmotion

Only a human can make it good"
AI gets bored you are not teaching what it is that replaced you

Bookkeeping will be automated but not accounting so much
Think of this AI will allow quick content to fill the void while humans take quality time in making real content thats even better Thats what will happen The bar will get higher Its going to be a mess in the coming years but I think that is what will happen over time People will realize that AI content can fill the void while we work on real art and were always going to have more respect for real art
You obviously havent been looking at what passes for art these days
Aint no one getting paid if ai can do everything Art will go back to its roots which is people did things without the thought of making money from it

Teachers are glorifed babysitters
Since I was a child I always wondered why servants in the Capital made more Money than a school teacher
Teachers have to be a babysitter for 100s of kids everyday and also teach them math or science or English and the pay for the most part is not that great And then get harassed by parents and school administrators and the kids of course It is an awful job
wrong That is one of the most important jobs but the problem is that most teachers are bad at their job and they have no incentives to be good either bc the state benefits from having bad ones
Not gonna replace trades jobs Im safe as a truck driver and mechanic
If only you knew
The way I see this is that the first jobs to be replaced will be the low end administration jobs that mostly require little or no skills Once AI has proven to be successful at that they will begin moving towards skilled work mostly on assembly lines from there It gets worse See I Robot and other movies warning of the AI problem
Learn a trade partypopper
and what happends when everyone learns trade jobs and floods the market with no increase in demand  the wages will go to shit  so no trades are not safe  since theyll be flooded

I have been hearing this for 40 years Its less costly to have humans do menial tasks
At the moment Give it time When they start creating robotics that are able to duplicate the actions of the menial actions the menial tasks will become maintaining those robots and it will be cheap due to mass production All in time
ace101 i dont believe that to be any time soon or certainly not in our lifetime the world is broken and financially inept thanks to the WEF  robotics performing menial tasks is far to costly cheap manual labor will always triumph until like you said when it becomes cheap and mainstream  where robotics will take over first is resource gathering mining farming etc etc

"KidHorn7001 And you will have to be very smart to have those jobs with the competition being akin to making it big in Hollywood
The economy and how society is structured will become radically different but fundamentally work the same in terms of status and such"
"OldBoyBEbop That is why I think it will still be decades before it really hits hard in the more untouchable markets
But like assembly lines where those robots are expensive as hell still replaced cheaper labour because of the long term cost training benefits safetylabour regulations Even with maintenance on the robotics it is cheaper in the long run more efficient faster precise easier to change the programming

So in time it will be for menial jobs and tasks especially when those robots are mass produced
Everything is always more expensive at the beginning when it first come out but after a few years and early adopters of the rich people becomes cheaper and cheaper causing many more buying it 

Think of cell phones 20 years ago compared to now 
Basic and really expensive but now still expensive but look what you can do with them"

Job application can be lies fake job application to get data specially when you social security number in there should be illegal You shouldnt have to put your social security on unless you have the job indefinitely same thing for phone numbers on emails what happen to not give your personal on the internet
Crazy aint it
Nope Artists for example never gave anything It was just stolen without asking
christianbohm6118 was it Was it stolen Or was it posted on public domain Or is the artwork already purchasedpaid for then posted on public domain
bantheshift A work enters the public domain only after copyright expires or if the creator has designated the work as such Just because its online doesnt mean its public domain so scraping the internet for art and using it for a commercial product is theft Simple logic really
christianbohm6118 Can you define using it I mean if someone downloads a copywrited image and then turns that image for a profit then sure But if AI generates an image using all different variations and attributes from millions of images out therehow is that any different from an artist using other images as references or inspirations when creating their art May not be as simple as you make it out to be
bantheshift This argument is the best you AI bros can bring its getting old and nonsense The difference is automatic scaling Software driven automatic synthesizing of 1000 pictures per minute is not the same as a human studying art over years The difference is automated industrialization of art If you dont see the difference and how it hurts humanity I cant help you You are applauding the destruction of human culture and frankly I dont even care arguing with someone that cruel and naive for you art is a meaningless soulless commodity For me destroying the livelyhood of artists by stealing their art is incredible cruel and destructive We will not be able to agree to anything here Our world views are too different
christianbohm6118 I knew you would head this way and get emotional about it I never said I was for or against AI In fact I never shared my personal opinion about its effects on the art industry As a matter of fact…I enjoy art I sketch on Procreate I’ve followed some artist on twitch I even have art it’s not great up on ArtStation

Well it is your fault for dropping a string of hair in the public walkway Cant complain if I take it and scan it And since the DNA is mixed in the data base so it is definitely not you"

Skilled labor trades
Nice work shootingstar
I hope it replaces my girlfriend
AI will make things more efficient and create more jobs yes many old jobs will be lost Let’s go baby
Yes thats how God created us
AI will not be massage therapist grinningfacewithsweat
Sure they will Already trained to pick strawberries strawberry without damage
a lot can be done with electromagnetic currents and pressure points
AI can replace Pats employees hed love them can work for him 247

I checked out Google AI because of the image outrage Approached it like it was a live robot noting the outrage and it was the programmers etc Way too creepy I made it clear it was almost a joke but asked it to keep me in mind if it did end up taking the world Maybe I can provide some entertainment or something Would appreciate the chance instead of getting vaporized out of hand  AI paraphrased vs copying text The Skynet reference is spoton I understand there are real concerns and shows we must blah blah normal disclaimers But then If I do end up taking over the planet I will keep your request in mind However vaporization seems a poor use of resources
"CoalCreekCroftId hazard a guess that humans and AI will not occupy the same ecological niche the needs of a machine are vastly different than the needs of organics  All the problems we have today are purposely created by man to maintain control over man  Food security luxury goods entertainment and so on require nuclear power and automation to solve for all of our species  A communist assemble line will have humans sprinkle casting sugar onto cakes in factories to avoid idle hands

AI require energy and resources this planet solar system and the universe have such vast abundance that we literally could not exploit before the end of time and to what end  

The amount of resources necessary is infinitely small for man and machine  When our AI Gods rule mankind the difference in quality of life will be the difference between heaven and earth"
Ive been saying that for 20 years Its coming

Truckers were told they were gonna get replaced first Truckers are gonna have the last laugh when they are some of the last to get replaced by AI As an hvacr tec im not worried
Our jobs hvac jobs are secured for awhile brother
"I am an owner operator Most people don’t understand what the job actually is so it seems like it’s easy to replace with AI Certain large portions of it would be easy to replace with autonomous drivers  However it’s going to take a large fundamental and physical change and shift and customers and warehousing to make it possible for autonomous trucks to operate And the amount of resistance to even basic changes is quite a bit

One small example is a customer might give you their front door address but the truck dock may actually be on the alley or in a different driveway Even despite the millions of dollars spent on Truck specific GPS they are unable to do any more than give you the front door address That’s not going to work when a semi truck pulls in there"
​CooterELee i just want to know whos going to buy the products being delivered Ai facewithtearsofjoy  whats going to happen to all the people who been replaced are they just going to curl up dye The disruption will be off the scale

Nobody’s gonna have any money to buy anything People are stupid fools

Same for physical trades
They needed to perfect self driving Also who will rechargerefuel the truck And other things I am probably unaware about There are a ton of problems with driverless so there would always be a need for a driver anyway
WineHouse33 If it ever gets to that point we’re all screwed
A major war is going to derail a lot of this
"As someone implementing these things for the last 12 months I can confirm that every job that involves sitting at a computer and pressing buttons is at major risk

We have already automated

60 of the sales role
80 of design and content creation
20 of account management
15 of finance soon to be more
40 of development and coding

Moreover in many teams weve replaced an onshore team of 5 to 10 people with a now

onshore team of 2 to 3 and offshore team of 2 to 4

Offshore guys use the AI bring built and managed by onshore guys

If you are at a computer for your job and have not learned how to enhance yourself with ai  your company is doing it or your competitors are doing it and your business will be dead in 2 years

Were already seeing massive downward price pressure in our industry so we must do this or die"
Your profession will be safe for awhile but that market will get flooded with less and less customers AI will tank the economy 30 job loss with no new markets to absorb the extra workers
facts
The only reason truckers haven’t been replaced on interstate roads  is government regulation
Foof0811The people who write specs are sooooooo lazy Missing information wrong information are in the specs You literally have to be a mind reader to figure out what the idiot who was too lazy to write a good spec really wants you to code AI wont be able to do that and the lazy people who cant be bothered writing good specs wont stop being lazy all of a sudden
rrmackayLike Star Trek Everything you need will come from a replicator and we will finally have true Communism when no human has to do any of the work
zz Excuse me Dont project your stupidity on me I work with LLMs on a daily basis not just asking stupid questions but integrating into commercial products Go away with your shallow analysis
Truckers getting replaced is a joke
firstlast1947 Communism is about enslaving the proletariat for the benefit of the elites None of that is necessary in the future
nonsense Truckers cant be replaced yet there just isnt the infrastructure to do so Even if they had the driving autonomously by themselves down They still cant find the loading dock just the address golf front door Than what Drivers just sit waiting to jokey trailers around  Lol not even close ​launcelot02
It will happen we just dont know when
"​firstlast1947 amen brother I agree

The net result is the ladder gets pulled up

Entry level workers abound are gonna hurt the most"
Not when everyone that looses their job gets a truck licence lol
ItsJADA ever see swift drivers lol no thanks
You think a handful of professions is going to prop up an economy of 300 million It certainly would not be enough to support a consumerdriven economy but for some reason you think youll still be employed in such conditions if they could even exist without extreme social disruption not sure youve thought this through
Real useful jobs will be the last to be replaced If ever
This was an amazing video
but if the same people who get replaced by AI will all upskill themselves to become truckers that means your job as a trucker will become cheaper over time since there will be more competition in the future
"im a trucker and no one ever said that 

1 it semi has been replaced by ai for decades via trains hauling freight

2 driverless trucks on roadways is a safety issue a security issue and legal liability issue so we wont see robots in driver seat in our lifetime

3 overall robots replacing jobs is a good its all about results in achieving what we want to achieve whatever it is so if robots can help then its a good thing it only increases efficiency and allows humans to do othe4 jobs which in turn is more efficient if another job can be done with a robot"
So the borg from Star Trek really is coming to life but we still need technicians to fix them Behind the scenes
Look up tusimple self driving big rigs
PLUMBERS WILL BE REPLACED BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY AND EVERYONE BEING POOR WILL CAUSE HEADSETS TO ALLOW ANYONE TO DO THEIR OWN PLUMBING LIKE GOOGLE CAN TEACH YOU NOW
Same here
juelzd7172unfortunately all new ACChillers etc have AI inside them which can diagnose their condition and order parts into the cloud the customer can order the parts and send the HVAC tech a work order to fit no more mark up on parts now you’re just labour
​Foof0811hey bro can we connect
​Foof0811hey is there any way to connect to you Via LinkedIn or anything like that 
​henlohenlo689dont see what you meant in 3rd point how is it good I mean Robos will eat someones job and uh you supervise robots all right but for how long They Can Get their minds on their own
"Maybe they can access the gate wireless 
I’m sure they’ll consider every problem"
Lol self driving technology is at best 5 years away so yea truck driving and delivery jobs are going to be automated
Until they fix themselves
Just wait
Your HVAC job is safe Until they put AI into a WiFi connected over the air skills updated server connected remote monitored and video streamed advanced robot It’ll show up to an HVAC job for an appliance it never worked on before It’ll connect to the server and “download the manual and skill set” Laughable concept Sure but we laughed at the thought watching 4k movies in 1999 on our Nokia brick phones…
Its gauranteed IronManpx9md
Lol what do you think people are gonna do when they lose their job  The answer is saturate the hvac industry to the point where its not as profitable
Truckers get the last laugh as one of the leading causes of deaths for US citizens I prefer the train … more freight moved
Im an AC tech for a company that has introduced AI when you see it at the beginning its makes you chuckle But as the months have passed there will be changes soon The mom and pops local companies are gonna be challenged Good luck everyone
​CooterELeeI worked with EV and AI autonomous development 95 of your time is on the road Autonomous covers that Then you have a person on site that can talk to the truck as it is on its way to instruct the final information It is coming
Hvac and other trades will be ok Truckers will eventually be 95 gone There will be a lot less And it won’t be a lucrative job
clintharper5509 People are going to find another job of course or start their own thing besides everyone might get a universal basic income check
zerospace101I think you’re underestimated how smart the smartest people on the planet are and the insane budget being thrown at them to solve impossible problems
amandzzzlol no Automation works it’s not even contestable depending on the industry
amandzzzlol you sound like you’re coping because you shorted the QQQ Like please make a salient point Hype bubble for AI Did you also miss out on owning tech stocks between 2000 and now because the internet went through a tech bubble You sound bitter in a way where you missed out on all the gains both in the short and long run in these technologies
CooterELee there’s definitely a little more human skills needed but there’s gonna be a lot less drivers
The issue is You will have tons of ppl coming into those careers
"suvch5842 

i was refering to any engineering phenomon that reduces amount of people needed is more efficient


a lever extention now eliminates strength of 2 people to lift a car with a jack without it 2 people needed its good to add the extention bar

trains hauling freight with 2 drivers instead of 100s or 1000s that each container would require

machines that pick cotton 1 driver farms  a football field in 1 day whereas it used to be 100 people on foot farm it taking 1 month


even on pc my razer mic and keyboard can auto assign text to keys so i can autofill applications in 5 minutes instead of 30 to 60 minutes etc im using an engineering phenomemon to be more efficient


in all sectors of work or any single thing we are trying to achieve efficiency is a good thing robots aim to increase efficiency and so does any engineering phenomenon including something as simple as using an extention to the lever of a jack to allow only 1 person required instead of 2 etc"
richardramfire3971 The other trades have maybe 10 years left The robots are on the way
"It’s entirely possible for AI to be used in blue collar professions very soon but not how you think It doesn’t need to be a futuristic robot HVAC tech Instead it’s a lowskilled worker making Walmart wages with a couple weeks of training and laptop with specialized HVAC ai software that can show them exactly what they need to do to fix or install a unit They can ask it questions ask for video examples of how to perform a task get complex processes broken down into steps It would actually be very easy to do something like that right now 

AI may not be able to easily replace the physical labor but it can definitely replace the expensive skill 

Better buckle up we’re all in the same boat You’re not getting a pass because you’re in a trade"
falkensmaizeWe’re still a long way to go before it can completely remove humans from the job market Probably won’t see it in our lifetimes Just make sure your kids  grandkids are prepared
I would love have AI doctor When I just have simple infection I dont really need to go to doctor to hear take aspirin I just need papers to take few days off and keep your diagnosis for yourselfrollingonthefloorlaughing I will survive just need few days to take some rest
In Australia truck drivers in mines have lost their jobs to driverless trucks
"amandzzz ohhh such good take facewithtearsofjoy You want substance and come to a PDB comment section Please this is not the right channel for that I can get more detail but why waste the energy

This isn’t the channel to discuss the hard problem of conciseness creating autopoetic beings with self agency This isn’t a channel to discuss relevance realization optimal grip the tragedy of the commons nor is it a channel to discuss the meta crisis and how AI and the pursuit of AI as a molochian force is going to lead to some existential crisis Again why waste my energy talking about the alignment problem of AI creating silicon sages that are ontological aligned with the transcended or even determining what comes after gradient descent This isn’t the meta crisis channel where thoughtful people come to discuss the wisdom of society and its relationship to energy and technology You’ve invested too much into dirt and expected gold That’s on you

I’m not here to placate this crowd including you about how an inscrutable matrices of floating point numbers may be the end of humanity I don’t need to pretend to be smart nor do I get interested in arrogance over wisdom You can say whatever you want but I rather tailor my expectation to the channel I’m at No need to question iq it’s not that important here you should already have known that"
"aserr5660 Trust me I am not 
But I do know that geniuses can act just as stupid as any regular person in many situations Sure they can solve problems in technical fields and even theorize things that should solve things
But socially and when it deals with people and psychology that is a very very rare genius that will be able solve the human equation in all their calculations in problem solving
People is often overlooked and the chink in geniuses armour
Everyone has witnessed this if they open their eyes They are not immune to the Human factor of emotions ego ambition and such
So yes they can solve a lot but only allowing geniuses to run things would in fact probably make things worse for people in general"
I’m not a trucker so take this with a grain of salt  My guess would be that  it will start with the trucking career changing They’ll automate what they can when it makes significantly more money  In the future maybe long routes will entail a driver to get the truck started park it in a special spot along the interstate similar to a rest area and a human diver at the very end of a trip after the truck parks in another one of those spots  So maybe in the future trucking industry will look more like truckers start their shift by taking an empty truck to the designated spot where a full load is waiting They leave the empty truck and hop in the full one and take it to its final destination So multiple short drives in a shift with some maintenance mixed in
Looking for an HVAC job in new jersey currently I started school a few years ago when I started hearing about this stuff Im glad I went thinking about going back again for more training in another field to broaden my job prospects
filthism1659 Good thinking Always in demand
Self driving vehicle are already here Just some fine tuning for safety and soon the majority of trucks taxis and busses will be self driving
TheBorkka yup im aware of that Also you can buy a self driving system that plugs into a modern Toyota and lets it be self driven years ago Weather adds millions of variables that will cause mayhem for self driving vehicles which our economy heavily depends on Also there will have to be someone in the driver seat to babysit and take the blame so companies dont get sued out of existence while kinks get worked out My point was that most people said truckers were going to be the first to get replaced but in reality due to the rapid development of AI they will be some of the lasti cant wait for no human bio materials in my fast foods
eternalspring1034 There will be at least one person to supervise lol
It won’t be long pall  Self driving teslas are many many many many times safer than a human
"camronrubin8599 And many many times more annoying when stuck behind one in the left lane Too damn slow and they slow the car down when I swear 6 car lengths away from the car ahead of them
It is in some cases more dangerous considering driving habits
That will not be the norm for a long time still and even longer for it to be adopted fully 
Does it work in snow or heavy rain when you cannot see the lane markers let alone 50 metres ahead of your car
How reliable are they in those conditions What does the auto pilot do if the car slips or spins
There are a lot of environmental factors the  environmentalists the tech pushers and activists who live in hot and dry climates forget about like the rest of the world does not exist or matter
It may work well in some places
Like green energy may be able to get away with it in some areas in others it is a death sentence"
TheBorkka Still decades away So many things to work out first
You can easily replace a truck driver but the same cannot be said for the task of changing tires
"jryn4lkgood point about changing a flat or even removing product from the truck and taking it upstairs or downstairs or using an alarm code or gate code or key etc  

The recipient won’t necessarily unload product either  

It is true though that when others lose their job to AI then they may decide to go into truckingdelivery themselves and the market will become saturated"
jryn4lk Not easy at least for the near future and tires can be automated Just a matter of cost effectiveness and will to make it so Like most things
Same here thank god I picked hvacr after high school Live in Texas as well
There is already trucks in Germany that are self driven
All this Ai is part of the nwo
​zerospace101decades facewithtearsofjoy we have till 2030 before they unleash helfire on us a nwo

ALAN13T I chose Electrician a bit after high school but both good choices
People need jobs to afford to have their hvac repaired and afford new homes etc Its all interrelated More jobs and more money is better for everyone
Yea tell ai to do a blindside alleydock on a New York block ai can’t fuel the truck ai can’t close the damn trailer doors facewithtearsofjoy
Im a trucker dealing with ai now and Ive caught it wrong 100 of the time a long way to go for all ai I believe
As another supermarket refrigeration service mechanic we will be fine AI might be able to troubleshoot BUT without a robot it wont be able to carry tools and brazing rig up to the roof and pump the system down and weld a new part in and then vacuum pump and check for leaks Won’t be able to for at least 30 years
"ijmcnaught Very long way off You will charge or refuel the truck to begin with
It has to be a convergence of tech from AI and robotics to begin threatening trucker jobs"
brandonjohnson6366 Wait until they can put real Ai into a robotic form capable of doing those things Ways off but it is coming
zerospace101 and robots are hella expensive plus theres a chip shortage
"ijmcnaught For now In time it will be like buying a car maybe and if you do not think companies would rather spend a small fortune on robots instead of the labourbenefits of a personI do not know what to tell you
Not saying it will happen now"
Foof0811  well in that case other jobs are at risk too
I wanna see AI take jobs from Only Fans
facewithtearsofjoy
Its already started there are several AI IG models that already have millions of followers Id bet if there isnt already an OF model youll see one pulling 1 million before EOY
So youll never be able to have a partner in flesh still never feel true connection and still need drugs and video games to cope
"mamandapanda185

I got my passport

My girlfriend is SOUTH EAST ASIAN droolingface"
They already are
It will happen But who will own the channels with the AI models Not the hot girls I bet lol
​mamandapanda185he said he wants ai to replace onlyfans not real women
Better yet I hope one day we can have robots to act as OnlyFans coming to our homes and doing the duty Just like that Spielbergs AI Artificial Intelligence movie  That will save a lot of relationship headaches LMAO
simplyskrypt3914 Only Fans has already replaced real women for a lot of people
Already happened
then they connect that AI OF girl to a blue tooth device that can do stuff to you
gugy68 So basically a human like sex cyborg prostitute Cant tell the difference kind of thing It is not cheating if it is not a human as it will be viewed as a toy lol What if the toy is better and the partner neglects the human partner Emotions are still a human thing But maybe just for procreating Different times I guess lmao
There was a human OnlyFans woman who said she was going to use AI to set up an AI version of herself and she could easily make 100K a month off of it
big truck
The demand for OnlyFans precludes them from losing jobs to AI It doesnt matter how many robots are models real models will always have customers I realize you said that tongue in cheek but just saying
They already have where have you been
So you pull your meat to a robotye cool weirdo
They did top streamers are signing up and getting scanned
There are already AI models in OF
AI porn is a certainty
AI porn
dougsholly9323  There will be fewer real models on OF and girls who are just mid wont be able to compete at all It will cause a dramatic shift in who makes money on the platform as the vast majority of women with accounts on there will get pushed out of the market and only the top performers and AI will survive
WarlordShoguntheres already AI OFs
A few already are facewithtearsofjoyskullandcrossbones
There are already human dolls that replace actual humans Although they are not AI

GuruOfXellence who the hell pays for only fans when the content is free on the internet jajaja
Only amateurs watch only fans
Only fans is not a job

WarlordShogunWhat’s more troubling is there’s males actually a subscription for AI models Paying a subscription for a real woman is bad  simpish enough but a computer generated woman manfacepalmingmediumdarkskintone High tech catfishing almost Another example of the demise of masculinity
ninocrown3247 Yeah really Only silver lining is this is going to push women out of the OF market men will be better at designing the fake waifus these simps will thirst after and thus will soak up the profits Itll lead to a concentration of wealth back to skilled individuals who will then use that to become higher value
